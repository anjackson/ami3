    There is a difference between class.getResource() (uses relative paths) and class.getClassLoader().getResource() (uses absolute paths) – Ferrybig Dec 20 '17 at 7:19

    You're just not supposed to have a leading slash. ClassLoader.getResource() doesn't expect one. Class.getResource() does, though, because without it, it looks for the resource in the same package as the class. – JB Nizet Dec 20 '17 at 7:19
    Are you using Java 9 modules? They alter the way that Class::getResource delegates. – Stephen C Dec 20 '17 at 7:35
    Thanks for your clarifications! It's indeed a difference between the class and the classloader I've missed! – Vitali Melamud Dec 20 '17 at 7:48
