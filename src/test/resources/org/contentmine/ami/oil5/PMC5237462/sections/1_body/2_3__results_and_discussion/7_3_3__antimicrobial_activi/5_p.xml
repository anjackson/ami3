<p class="p">The essential oil of
 <italic class="italic"> M. piperita</italic> has submitted inhibition zone in 100 mg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> concentrations at 7.6 ± 0,57 mm and 10 mg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> with 9 ± 1.0 mm for
 <italic class="italic"> S. aureus</italic> and
 <italic class="italic"> E. coli</italic>, respectively. Compared with positive control and concentrations tested, there was significant difference between the inhibition zones, in which the halo in the positive control showed halo of 15 mm. The nonoccurrence of menthol may have influence on the occurrence of only one strain of bacteria, whereas linalool is also described such as potential agent in the control of bacteria.
