<p class="p">Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in LPS-stimulated astrocytes were assessed by 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence measurements. Astrocytes were treated with LPS (1 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL) and then incubated with HR and SGR essential oils (100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL) for 24 h. The treatment of astrocytes with LPS induced a significant increase in ROS levels in comparison with the control cells. Our results showed that treatment with HR and SGR essential oils reduced intracellular levels of ROS about 1.5-fold in LPS-stimulated astrocytes in comparison with the cells treated with only LPS (
