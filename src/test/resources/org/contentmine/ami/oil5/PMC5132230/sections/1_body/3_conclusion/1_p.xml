<p class="p">The essential oil obtained from the leaves of 
 <italic class="italic">Aeollanthus suaveolens</italic> were chemically analyzed and determined the antioxidant, cytotoxic and antimicrobial activity. With regard to chemical analysis, the major compounds identified were (E) -β-farnesene, Linalool, α-Santalene, and linalyl acetate. The antimicrobial activity showed that the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">suaveolens</italic> showed better bacteriostatic potential for gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic>) than to gram-positive bacteria (
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) and potential bactericidal for gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">coli</italic>). The essential oil showed little antioxidant activity by DPPH radical capture method when compared with standard vitamin C and rutin. However, it showed high Cytotoxic activity on 
 <italic class="italic">Artemia salina</italic>. The data show the importance of preliminary bioassays as a screening of the biological potential of plant products, as well as the importance of these products as a source of bioactive compounds.
