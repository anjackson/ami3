<p class="p">For BeatoviÄ‡ et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0166684.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], the OE antioxidant capacity is related to their major compounds, but this study has not observed the antioxidant activity. Studies with 
 <italic class="italic">Ocimun basilicum</italic> species, and linalool as major compound showed strong antioxidant capacity [
 <xref rid="pone.0166684.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. On the other hand, Lu and Foo [
 <xref rid="pone.0166684.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] believe that most compounds act synergistically together producing a broad spectrum of antioxidant properties and thus create an effective defense against free radicals.
