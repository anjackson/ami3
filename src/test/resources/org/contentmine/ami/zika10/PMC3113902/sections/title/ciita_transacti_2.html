      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Class II transactivator exerts its transactivating function through protein–protein
         interactions with the components of the MHC-enhanceosome bound to the proximal SXY
         regulatory module in MHC promoters (Figure 
         <a>1</a>; Masternak et al., 
         <a>2000</a>; Zhu et al., 
         <a>2000</a>; Jabrane-Ferrat et al., 
         <a>2003</a>). This interaction of CIITA with the MHC-enhanceosome allows for the subsequent recruitment
         of the lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) p300 (KAT3b)/CREB binding protein (CBP or
         KAT3a) and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF or KAT2b), which promote transcription
         of 
         <span>MHC-I</span> and 
         <span>MHC-II</span> genes by providing a more open chromatin structure (Kretsovali et al., 
         <a>1998</a>; Fontes et al., 
         <a>1999</a>; Spilianakis et al., 
         <a>2000</a>; Gobin et al., 
         <a>2001</a>). Furthermore, CIITA also recruits the co-activator-associated arginine methyltransferase-1/protein
         arginine 
         <span>N</span>-methyltransferase 4 (CARM1/PRMT4; Zika and Ting, 
         <a>2005</a>; Zika et al., 
         <a>2005</a>; Figure 
         <a>1</a>). Besides acting as a platform for recruitment of KAT activities, CIITA itself contains
         intrinsic KAT activity. The CIITA-mediated transactivation of MHC promoters was found
         to rely on this intrinsic KAT activity, which maps to a region in its N-terminus (Raval
         et al., 
         <a>2001</a>). This KAT activity of CIITA is regulated by its C-terminal GTP-binding domain and
         is stimulated by GTP (Raval et al., 
         <a>2001</a>). Interestingly, the CIITA KAT activity was found to bypass TATA box binding protein
         (TBP)-associated factor 250 kDa (TAF
         <sub>II</sub>250) in MHC-I promoter activation (Raval et al., 
         <a>2001</a>). Moreover, acetylation of CIITA itself by CBP and/or PCAF at specific lysine residues
         within the bipartite nuclear localization signal in the amino-terminal region of CIITA
         governs its nuclear accumulation (Spilianakis et al., 
         <a>2000</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Class II transactivator also interacts with histone deacetylases (HDACs), which were
         found to interfere with CIITA function. These activities that acetylate/deacetylate
         lysine residues act as molecular switches for CIITA-mediated transcriptional activation/silencing
         of 
         <span>MHC</span> genes. In this respect, it was found that HDAC1 and HDAC2 interfere in the transcriptional
         transactivation function of CIITA following IFNγ induction (Zika et al., 
         <a>2003</a>; Kong et al., 
         <a>2009</a>). In mice the HDAC1/HDAC2-associated repressor SIN3 homolog A (mSin3A) amplifies
         this inhibition in CIITA function (Zika et al., 
         <a>2003</a>). HDAC2 has the potential to deacetylate CIITA through its interaction with CIITA
         (Kong et al., 
         <a>2009</a>). This results in targeting of CIITA to the proteasomal degradation machinery and
         decreased interaction of CIITA with the RFX component RFX5 (Kong et al., 
         <a>2009</a>). Together, these observations reveal that these HDAC activities affect CIITA function
         on the one hand by disrupting assembly of the MHC-enhanceosome, while on the other
         hand they interfere in CIITA interactions with the MHC-enhanceosome. The switch/sucrose
         non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) ATPase Brahma-related gene-1 (BRG-1) also associates with
         CIITA and is required for the CIITA-mediated induction of 
         <span>MHC-II</span> genes (Mudhasani and Fontes, 
         <a>2002</a>). The association of CIITA and BRG-1 suggest that the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling
         SWI/SNF complex is recruited by CIITA to MHC-II promoters to control transcription
         of 
         <span>MHC-II</span> genes. The ATPase Sug 1, a component of the 19S proteasome (19S P) complex, was found
         to be involved in increased levels of acetylation at MHC-II promoters and appeared
         to be essential for CIITA stability and 
         <span>MHC-II</span> expression (Bhat et al., 
         <a>2008</a>, 
         <a>2010a</a>; Koues et al., 
         <a>2008</a>). More recently, another subunit of the 19S proteosome complex, the ATPase S6a (S6′/Tat-binding
         protein 1), was found to be crucial for regulating cytokine-inducible transcription
         of CIITA thereby indirectly modulation 
         <span>MHC-II</span> transcription (Truax et al., 
         <a>2010</a>). Other activities involved monoubiquitination of CIITA, which was shown to stabilize
         CIITA at MHC-II promoters (Bhat et al., 
         <a>2010b</a>). In addition MLL/COMPASS subunits, which are involved in establishing active histone
         H3-K4 methylation marks, were found also to be recruited to MHC-II promoters following
         IFNγ treatment of cells (Koues et al., 
         <a>2010</a>; Figure 
         <a>1</a>).
