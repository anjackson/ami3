 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Activation of 
  <span class="italic">MHC-I</span> genes, with the exception of 
  <span class="italic">HLA-G</span>, is mediated by several conserved cis-acting regulatory promoter elements: i.e., the enhancer A, interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) and the SXY-module (comprising the S/W, X1, X2, and Y-boxes; Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a>). These conserved regulatory elements play an important role in the inducible and constitutive expression of 
  <span class="italic">MHC-I</span> genes (Van den Elsen et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B83" href="#B83">2004</a>). Interestingly, these regulatory elements are also involved in the transcriptional activation of the β2-microglobulin promoter but not of the promoters of the genes encoding the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and the large multifunctional protease (LMP), which are essential components in the MHC-I antigen processing and presentation pathway (Gobin et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B17" href="#B17">1997</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B21" href="#B21">2001</a>; Van den Elsen et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B83" href="#B83">2004</a>). In MHC-I promoters, the enhancer A is bound by nuclear factor (NF)-κB, while the ISRE is bound by interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family members (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a>; Gobin et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B19" href="#B19">1998</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B22" href="#B22">1999</a>). The transcription factors NF-κB and IRF-1 are mediators of the TNFα and IFNγ (Janus-family kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, Jak/STAT) routes of gene activation, respectively, which account for the induced 
  <span class="italic">MHC-I</span> transcription. Additionally, binding sites for upstream-stimulatory factor (USF)-1, -2 and for the transcription factor Sp-1 can also be found within these upstream regulatory promoter elements in a locus and allele-specific fashion (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a>; Gobin et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B19" href="#B19">1998</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B22" href="#B22">1999</a>). As a result of nucleotide sequence variation in the enhancer A and the ISRE in the different MHC-I promoters the level of promoter activation induced by these pathways differs among the various 
  <span class="italic">MHC-I</span> loci (Gobin et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B19" href="#B19">1998</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B22" href="#B22">1999</a>; Girdlestone, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B16" href="#B16">2000</a>; Johnson,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Expression of 
  <span class="italic">HLA-G</span> is under normal circumstances confined primarily to fetal trophoblast cells and thymic epithelium. This suggest an alternative transcriptional control of 
  <span class="italic">HLA-G</span> than that of the classical 
  <span class="italic">MHC-I</span> genes. Indeed, while encoding similar regulatory elements in its 5′ DNA, 
  <span class="italic">HLA-G</span> is not regulated by the upstream ISRE and κB sites or the SXY regulatory module (Gobin and Van den Elsen, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B20" href="#B20">1999</a>). Instead, the HLA-G promoter can be transactivated by the cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB)-1 (Gobin et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B18" href="#B18">2002</a>). This transactivation is mediated by further upstream positioned CRE sites, which can bind CREB-1, activating transcription factor (ATF)-1 and c-Jun 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a>; Gobin et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B18" href="#B18">2002</a>). Since these factors are ubiquitously expressed, the lack of 
  <span class="italic">HLA-G</span> expression in cell types other than trophoblast cells must be regulated in a different manner such as by alternative regulatory factors that suppress expression of 
  <span class="italic">HLA-G</span> or by epigenetic mechanisms. In this respect it was recently shown that Ras-responsive binding protein-1 (RREB-1) is a transcriptional repressor of 
  <span class="italic">HLA-G</span>, which exerts its function through chromatin remodeling of the 
  <span class="italic">HLA-G</span> locus by virtue of its interaction with subunits of the CtBP complex in cells that lack expression of 
  <span class="italic">HLA-G</span> (Flajollet et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B12" href="#B12">2009</a>). Additionally, it has also been demonstrated that treatment of various types of cells lacking 
  <span class="italic">HLA-G</span> expression with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5′-AZA-deoxycytidine results in restoration of 
  <span class="italic">HLA-G</span> transcription (Moreau et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B55" href="#B55">2003</a>). Besides DNA methylation, histone acetylation modifications have also been implicated in the transcriptional control of 
  <span class="italic">HLA-G</span> in trophoblast cell lines (Holling et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">2009</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SXY-module is also present is the promoters of 
  <span class="italic">MHC-II</span> and its accessory genes (
  <span class="italic">invariant chain</span>, 
  <span class="italic">HLA-DM</span> and 
  <span class="italic">HLA-DO</span>). However, MHC-II promoters differ from MHC-I promoters in that they lack the typical enhancer A and ISRE (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a>). The sequence and stereo-specific alignment of the various boxes in the SXY-module is highly conserved and critical for its functioning in constitutive and inducible-transcriptional activation of 
  <span class="italic">MHC-I</span> and 
  <span class="italic">MHC-II</span> genes (Gobin et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B21" href="#B21">2001</a>; Ting and Trowsdale, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B80" href="#B80">2002</a>). The SXY-module is cooperatively bound by a multi-protein complex containing regulatory factor X (RFX; consisting of RFX5, RFXB/ANK, and RFXAP; Steimle et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B78" href="#B78">1995</a>; Durand et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B11" href="#B11">1997</a>; Masternak et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B49" href="#B49">1998</a>; Nagarajan et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B65" href="#B65">1999</a>), CREB/ATF (Moreno et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B56" href="#B56">1999</a>; Gobin et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B21" href="#B21">2001</a>), and nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y; Louis-Plence et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B43" href="#B43">1997</a>; Jabrane-Ferrat et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">2002</a>). This complex acts as an enhanceosome driving transactivation of these genes (Masternak et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B50" href="#B50">2000</a>; Gobin et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B21" href="#B21">2001</a>; Choi et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">2011</a>). The presence of the RFX components is crucial for the assembly of this enhanceosome, a notion that has been derived from studies with cell lines established from MHC-II deficiency patients (Reith and Mach, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B72" href="#B72">2001</a>). In addition to these factors that assemble directly to the X1, X2, and Y-box sequences the class II transactivator (CIITA), which acts as a co-activator, is also required. CIITA is essential for 
  <span class="italic">MHC-II</span> transcription (Steimle et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B79" href="#B79">1993</a>), while it contributes to the activation of MHC-I promoters (Gobin et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B17" href="#B17">1997</a>; Martin et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B48" href="#B48">1997</a>). CIITA belongs to the large NLR (nucleotide binding domain, leucine-rich repeat containing) family of proteins that play multiple functions in innate immune responses (Harton et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B26" href="#B26">2002</a>; Ting et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B81" href="#B81">2008</a>). Despite the fact that CIITA activates MHC-I promoters 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span>, its 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span> contribution to 
  <span class="italic">MHC-I</span> gene transcription remained enigmatic. It is therefore of note that more recently the NLR family member NLRC5 was identified to associate with and activate the promoters of 
  <span class="italic">MHC-I</span> genes and not 
  <span class="italic">MHC-II</span> genes 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span> (Meissner et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B54" href="#B54">2010</a>). Like CIITA, NLRC5 also induced the expression of the gene encoding β2-microglobulin. However, in contrast to CIITA, NLRC5 was also found to control the expression of the genes encoding TAP and LMP. These observations reveal that NLRC5 appears to be a transcriptional regulator, which orchestrates the concerted expression of critical components in the MHC-I antigen presentation pathway (Meissner et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B54" href="#B54">2010</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the essential role of CIITA in 
  <span class="italic">MHC-II</span> transcription, constitutive expression of CIITA coincides with constitutive MHC-II molecule expression in APCs. In non-immune cells expression of CIITA can be induced by IFNγ resulting in inducible MHC-II expression at the cell surface. CIITA therefore can be regarded as a molecular switch for MHC-II expression. Transcriptional activation of 
  <span class="italic">MHC-II</span> genes also involves modulation of covalent histones modifications and chromatin remodeling (Choi et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">2011</a>). As an example, IFNγ-induced MHC-II expression results in an increase in active histone marks, i.e., acetylation of histone H3 and H4, and 3meK4-H3 at the MHC-II promoter, while at the same time a decrease in the repressive 3meK9-H3 histone mark is noted (Chou and Tomasi, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B9" href="#B9">2008</a>).
