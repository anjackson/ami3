 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The appropriate temporal and spatial expression of 
  <span class="italic">MHC-II</span> genes 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span> also requires the involvement of additional, long-range regulatory elements. The more distal X–Y or X-box like sequences in the 
  <span class="italic">MHC-II</span> region play an important role in these processes (Gomez et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B23" href="#B23">2005</a>). It has been found that interactions between the proximal elements and more distal X–Y or X-box like sequences (2.3 kb upstream of the HLA-DRA promoter) result in epigenetic changes at the MHC-II promoter (Masternak et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B51" href="#B51">2003</a>; Wright and Ting, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B92" href="#B92">2006</a>; Choi et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">2011</a>). In one model, RFX and CIITA can interact with the proximal SXY-module and with distal X–Y or X-box like sequences to form a chromatin loop (Masternak et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B51" href="#B51">2003</a>). This chromatin loop results in enhanced histone acetylation (Krawczyk et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B40" href="#B40">2004</a>). Likewise, the transcriptional insulator factor CCCTC binding factor insulator (CTCF) was found to control 
  <span class="italic">MHC-II</span> gene expression through long-distance chromatin interactions (Majumder et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B47" href="#B47">2008</a>). The intergenic DNA of the 
  <span class="italic">HLA-DRB1</span> and 
  <span class="italic">HLA-DQA1</span> genes hosts a region that was bound by CTCF and acts as a potent enhancer-blocking element (Majumder et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B46" href="#B46">2006</a>). This element and its bound factors were found to interact with 
  <span class="italic">HLA-DRB1</span> and 
  <span class="italic">HLA-DQA1</span> (Majumder et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B47" href="#B47">2008</a>). Subsequently it was demonstrated that CTCF associates with CIITA and RFX5 suggesting that the CTCF bound region and the flanking HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1 proximal promoters may interact (Majumder et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B47" href="#B47">2008</a>). More recently it was shown by RNAi depletion of CTCF that all CIITA-regulated genes within the 
  <span class="italic">MHC-II</span> locus required CTCF for maximal expression (Majumder and Boss, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B45" href="#B45">2010</a>).
