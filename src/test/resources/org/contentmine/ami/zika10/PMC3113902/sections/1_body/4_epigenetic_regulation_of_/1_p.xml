<p class="p">Transcriptional regulation of 
 <italic class="italic">MHC2TA</italic>, the gene encoding CIITA, is mediated through the activity of four independent promoter units (CIITA-PI through CIITA-PIV; Muhlethaler-Mottet et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62" class="xref">1997</xref>; Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>). These promoter units are employed in a cell type- and activation-specific manner. CIITA-PI and CIITA-PIII are used for the constitutive expression in dendritic cells and in B cells, respectively (Muhlethaler-Mottet et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62" class="xref">1997</xref>). CIITA-PIV has been shown to be the promoter predominantly involved in IFNγ-inducible expression (Muhlethaler-Mottet et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61" class="xref">1998</xref>; Piskurich et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70" class="xref">1998</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69" class="xref">1999</xref>). In addition, in human non-B cells, CIITA-PIII can also be activated by IFNγ through an element located 2 kb upstream of the core CIITA-PIII promoter (Piskurich et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69" class="xref">1999</xref>; Van der Stoep et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88" class="xref">2002a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86" class="xref">2007</xref>). CIITA-PIII has also been shown to be employed by human T cells upon activation (Holling et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30" class="xref">2002</xref>; Wong et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91" class="xref">2002</xref>). The promoter function of CIITA-PII is still ill-defined. The various 
 <italic class="italic">MHC2TA</italic> promoters each transcribe a unique first exon and are located within a region of approximately 14 kb (Muhlethaler-Mottet et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62" class="xref">1997</xref>).
