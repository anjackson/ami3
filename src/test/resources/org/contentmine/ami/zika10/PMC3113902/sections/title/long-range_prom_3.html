      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The appropriate temporal and spatial expression of 
         <span>MHC-II</span> genes 
         <span>in vivo</span> also requires the involvement of additional, long-range regulatory elements. The
         more distal X–Y or X-box like sequences in the 
         <span>MHC-II</span> region play an important role in these processes (Gomez et al., 
         <a>2005</a>). It has been found that interactions between the proximal elements and more distal
         X–Y or X-box like sequences (2.3 kb upstream of the HLA-DRA promoter) result in epigenetic
         changes at the MHC-II promoter (Masternak et al., 
         <a>2003</a>; Wright and Ting, 
         <a>2006</a>; Choi et al., 
         <a>2011</a>). In one model, RFX and CIITA can interact with the proximal SXY-module and with
         distal X–Y or X-box like sequences to form a chromatin loop (Masternak et al., 
         <a>2003</a>). This chromatin loop results in enhanced histone acetylation (Krawczyk et al., 
         <a>2004</a>). Likewise, the transcriptional insulator factor CCCTC binding factor insulator (CTCF)
         was found to control 
         <span>MHC-II</span> gene expression through long-distance chromatin interactions (Majumder et al., 
         <a>2008</a>). The intergenic DNA of the 
         <span>HLA-DRB1</span> and 
         <span>HLA-DQA1</span> genes hosts a region that was bound by CTCF and acts as a potent enhancer-blocking
         element (Majumder et al., 
         <a>2006</a>). This element and its bound factors were found to interact with 
         <span>HLA-DRB1</span> and 
         <span>HLA-DQA1</span> (Majumder et al., 
         <a>2008</a>). Subsequently it was demonstrated that CTCF associates with CIITA and RFX5 suggesting
         that the CTCF bound region and the flanking HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1 proximal promoters
         may interact (Majumder et al., 
         <a>2008</a>). More recently it was shown by RNAi depletion of CTCF that all CIITA-regulated genes
         within the 
         <span>MHC-II</span> locus required CTCF for maximal expression (Majumder and Boss, 
         <a>2010</a>).
