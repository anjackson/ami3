 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transcriptional regulation of 
  <span class="italic">MHC2TA</span>, the gene encoding CIITA, is mediated through the activity of four independent promoter units (CIITA-PI through CIITA-PIV; Muhlethaler-Mottet et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B62" href="#B62">1997</a>; Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2</a>). These promoter units are employed in a cell type- and activation-specific manner. CIITA-PI and CIITA-PIII are used for the constitutive expression in dendritic cells and in B cells, respectively (Muhlethaler-Mottet et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B62" href="#B62">1997</a>). CIITA-PIV has been shown to be the promoter predominantly involved in IFNγ-inducible expression (Muhlethaler-Mottet et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B61" href="#B61">1998</a>; Piskurich et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B70" href="#B70">1998</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B69" href="#B69">1999</a>). In addition, in human non-B cells, CIITA-PIII can also be activated by IFNγ through an element located 2 kb upstream of the core CIITA-PIII promoter (Piskurich et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B69" href="#B69">1999</a>; Van der Stoep et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B88" href="#B88">2002a</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B86" href="#B86">2007</a>). CIITA-PIII has also been shown to be employed by human T cells upon activation (Holling et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B30" href="#B30">2002</a>; Wong et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B91" href="#B91">2002</a>). The promoter function of CIITA-PII is still ill-defined. The various 
  <span class="italic">MHC2TA</span> promoters each transcribe a unique first exon and are located within a region of approximately 14 kb (Muhlethaler-Mottet et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B62" href="#B62">1997</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the past years, several regulatory elements in 
  <span class="italic">MHC2TA</span> promoters and interacting factors that are important for transcriptional activation have been identified (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2</a>). IFNγ-mediated activation of CIITA-PIV requires occupation of the gamma-activated sequence (GAS)-box and the ISRE in CIITA-PIV by STAT-1 and the STAT-1 target gene IRF-1 (Muhlethaler-Mottet et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B61" href="#B61">1998</a>). Importantly, STAT-1 needs to interact with USF-1 bound to the E-box adjacent to the GAS-box for stable interaction (Muhlethaler-Mottet et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B61" href="#B61">1998</a>; Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2</a>). The IFNγ-mediated activation of CIITA-PIV also results in increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation at CIITA-PIV (Morris et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B58" href="#B58">2002</a>). Interestingly, this increase in histone acetylation in CIITA-PIV chromatin is already noted prior to recruitment of IRF-1 to the CIITA-PIV promoter (Morris et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B58" href="#B58">2002</a>). In addition to the factors interacting with these CIIT-PIV promoter elements, the SWI/SNF ATPase BRG-1 was also found to be an important factor in the IFNγ-mediated transcriptional activation of CIITA-PIV because cells that lack expression of BRG-1 failed to induce CIITA expression following exposure to IFNγ (Pattenden et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B67" href="#B67">2002</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Class II transactivator-PIII is employed in B cells and activated T cells in humans (Ghosh et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B15" href="#B15">1999</a>; Holling et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B30" href="#B30">2002</a>; Van der Stoep et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B88" href="#B88">2002a</a>; Wong et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B91" href="#B91">2002</a>). Activation of CIITA-PIII requires interaction of the transcription factor CREB-1 with CRE-binding sites in the activation response element (ARE)-2 and, depending on the cellular context, also with CRE-binding sites in the 5′-UTR of CIITA-PIII (Holling et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B30" href="#B30">2002</a>; Van der Stoep et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B88" href="#B88">2002a</a>; Wong et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B91" href="#B91">2002</a>). The CREB-1 mediated activation of CIITA-PIII in B cells was amplified by the KAT CBP (Van der Stoep et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B88" href="#B88">2002a</a>). CIITA-PIII also contains a composite Ets/ISRE-consensus element (Site C) and 2 E-box motifs, which were found to play a crucial role in its B cell-specific transcriptional regulation (Van der Stoep et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B87" href="#B87">2004</a>). In B cells the Ets/ISRE-consensus element is bound by PU.1 and IRF-4, whereas the basic helix-loop-helix factor E47 interacts with the E-box motifs. When bound respectively to the Ets/ISRE and E-boxes PU.1 and IRF-4, and E47 synergize to direct B cell-specific activation of CIITA-PIII (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2</a>; Van der Stoep et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B87" href="#B87">2004</a>). The involvement of these factors in B cell-specific activation of CIITA-PIII is of interest because PU.1, IRF-4, and E47 also play an important role in B cell differentiation and activation.

  <span class="italic">In vivo</span> footprint analysis of CIITA-PI in immature dendritic cells revealed multiple protein/DNA interactions that were lost upon maturation of dendritic cells. CIITA-PI was found to contain binding sites for PU.1, Sp-1 NF-κB, and a composite Ets/ISRE (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2</a>; Smith et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B76" href="#B76">2011</a>). Transcription mediated by CIITA-PI in immature dendritic cells requires binding of PU.1, IRF-8, NF-κB, and Sp-1 to the promoter (Smith et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B76" href="#B76">2011</a>). Interestingly, for binding of PU.1 to the composite Ets/ISRE heterodimerization with IRF-8 is a prerequisite. Mutational analysis of the PU.1, IRF-8, and NF-κB sites showed that these sites were critical for transcriptional activity of CIITA-PI. Of note is also that mice lacking IRF-8 displayed an unoccupied CIITA-PI, which was restored by reconstitution with IRF-8 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> (Smith et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B76" href="#B76">2011</a>). Together, these observations reveal an important role for PU.1/IRF-8 in the activation of CIITA-PI in immature dendritic cells.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plasma B cells lack expression of CIITA (Silacci et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B75" href="#B75">1994</a>). This extinction of CIITA and resulting MHC-II molecule expression during differentiation of B cells into plasma B cells is mediated by the transcriptional repressor B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1, also known as positive regulatory domain I-binding factor 1, PRDI-BF1; Piskurich et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B68" href="#B68">2000</a>; Ghosh et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B14" href="#B14">2001</a>). The silencing of CIITA expression in plasma cells is most likely resulting from binding of Blimp-1 to the Ets/ISRE-consensus element in CIITA-PIII thereby disrupting the interaction of PU.1/IRF-4 to this element (Piskurich et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B68" href="#B68">2000</a>; Ghosh et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B14" href="#B14">2001</a>; Wright and Ting, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B92" href="#B92">2006</a>). Interestingly, besides its repressive activity on CIITA-PIII transactivation, there is more recent evidence that PRDI-BF1 mediates also repression of CIITA-PIV (Chen et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B5" href="#B5">2007</a>). Transcriptional repression of 
  <span class="italic">MHC2TA</span> mediated by Blimp-1/PRDI-BF1 is also associated with histone deacetylase and lysine methyltransferase (KMT) activities (Yu et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B94" href="#B94">2000</a>; Gyory et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B25" href="#B25">2004</a>). In particular the activities of the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, and the lysine methyltransferase KMT1C (also known as G9a), are required in these epigenetic silencing processes. Indeed it was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) that differences between B cells and plasma cells exist in the levels of activating and repressive histone marks in CIITA-PIII chromatin (Green et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B24" href="#B24">2006</a>). In plasma cells lacking CIITA expression, histone marks associated with gene transcription such as acetylated histone H3 and H4, and 2meK4-H3 and 3meK4-H3 are lost at CIITA-PIII, while the repressive 2meK9-H3 mark is increased (Green et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B24" href="#B24">2006</a>). Interestingly these histone marks were found also to exist at CIITA-PI, CIITA-PII and CIITA-PIV, revealing the involvement of the entire 
  <span class="italic">MHC2TA</span> multi-promoter region. As a consequence of the repressive histone marks and resulting chromatin inaccessibility, the binding of CIITA-PIII interacting transcription factors (i.e., Sp-1, CREB-1, E47, PU.1, IRF-4) was lost in plasma cells (Green et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B24" href="#B24">2006</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In dendritic cell maturation chromatin remodeling also plays an important role in the control of 
  <span class="italic">MHC2TA</span> transcription (Landmann et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B42" href="#B42">2001</a>; Choi et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B7" href="#B7">2009</a>). During differentiation of monocytes into immature dendritic cells the CIITA-PI isoform is induced. In immature dendritic cells, MHC-II molecules are largely retained in intracellular compartments. Upon maturation of dendritic cells, the peptide/MHC-II complexes are assembled and transported to the cell surface. The increase of transported MHC-II molecules at the cell surface is accompanied by rapid transcriptional silencing of 
  <span class="italic">MHC2TA</span> in matured dendritic cells (Landmann et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B42" href="#B42">2001</a>). Like in plasma B cells, the transcriptional inactivation of CIITA-PI is also accompanied by global histone deacetylation involving not only CIITA-PI but also CIITA-PIII and CIITA-PIV (Landmann et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B42" href="#B42">2001</a>). In a mouse model activation of CIITA-PI, during differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells by mGM-CSF, is accompanied by an increase in the levels of acetylated histone H3 and H4 (Choi et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B7" href="#B7">2009</a>). IL-10 could block the increase in histone H3 and H4 acetylation during differentiation resulting in inhibition of 
  <span class="italic">MHC2TA</span> transcription (Choi et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B7" href="#B7">2009</a>). Recently the involvement of the transcriptional repressor PRD1-BF1/Blimp-1 in these CIITA-PI silencing processes was revealed (Smith et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B76" href="#B76">2011</a>). It was shown that during dendritic cell maturation binding to CIITA-PI of the transcriptional activators PU.1, IRF-8, NF-κB, and Sp-1 is lost while at the same time the transcriptional repressor PRD1-BF1/Blimp-1 and its associated co-repressors KMT1C and HDAC2 are recruited to CIITA-PI (Smith et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B76" href="#B76">2011</a>). This results in a loss of histone acetylation and acquisition of histone K9-H3 dimethylation and heterochromatin protein 1γ (HP1γ) at CIITA-PI (Smith et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B76" href="#B76">2011</a>). Together, the transcriptional repressor PRD1-BF1/Blimp-1 appears to play a central role in the extinction of the various CIITA promoters and therefore can be regarded as a central regulator of MHC-II antigen presentation (Smith et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B76" href="#B76">2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Distal elements and chromatin remodeling also play an essential role in the transcriptional regulation of 
  <span class="italic">MHC2TA</span> (Ni et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B66" href="#B66">2008</a>). Transcriptional activation of CIITA-PIV by IFNγ relies on the interaction with distal elements at −50 and −8 kb (Ni et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B66" href="#B66">2008</a>). Contact was also detected between elements at −50 and −16 kb. In these long-range interactions, BRG-1, the ATPase driving the chromatin remodeling complex SWI-SNF (also called BAF), was constitutively bound to sites at −50, −16, −8, and +59 kb, and also CIITA-IV (Ni et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B66" href="#B66">2008</a>). Thus BRG-1 not only is an important factor in the CIITA-mediated activation of 
  <span class="italic">MHC-II</span> genes, but also controls the transcriptional activation of 
  <span class="italic">MHC2TA</span> itself through long-range chromatin and promoter interactions.
