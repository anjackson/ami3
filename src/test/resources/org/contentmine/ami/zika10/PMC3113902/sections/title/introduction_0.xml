 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The products of the 
  <span class="italic">MHC class I (MHC-I)</span> and 
  <span class="italic">MHC class II (MHC-II)</span> genes encode cell-surface glycoproteins involved in the binding and presentation of peptides to the T cell receptors (TCRs) of T lymphocytes. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I proteins present peptides from endogenous sources, such as those derived from viruses, to CD8
  <span class="sup">+</span> T cells, whereas MHC-II molecules mainly present peptides from exogenous sources, such as those derived from extracellular pathogens, to CD4
  <span class="sup">+</span> T cells. These tri-molecular interactions of MHC, peptide, and TCR are central to the generation of antigen-specific immune responses.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
  <span class="italic">MHC-I</span> gene cluster encodes the highly polymorphic classical MHC-I molecules (human leukocyte antigen, HLA-A, -B, and -C), which play essential roles in the detection and elimination of virus-infected cells, tumor cells and transplanted allogeneic cells and the less polymorphic non-classical MHC-Ib molecules (HLA-E, -F, and -G). These latter MHC-Ib molecules have specialized immune regulatory functions (Van den Elsen et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B83" href="#B83">2004</a>). All cell-surface expressed MHC-I and MHC-Ib molecules are associated with the non-polymorphic β2-microglobulin.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MHC-II genes encode the polymorphic HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP molecules, which are expressed as α- and β-chain heterodimers on the cell surface. MHC-II molecules are central in the initiation of cellular and humoral immune responses, but they have also been implicated as contributing factors for a variety of autoimmune disorders. In contrast to the classical MHC-I molecules, which are expressed in a constitutive fashion on almost all nucleated cells, the constitutive expression of MHC-II molecules is tissue-specific and is restricted to professional antigen presenting cells (APCs, i.e., dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells) and in thymic epithelial cells (Van den Elsen et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B83" href="#B83">2004</a>). All other cell types lack constitutive expression of MHC-II molecules, but their expression can be induced by exposure to cytokines of which interferon γ (IFNγ) is the most potent, or upon activation, such as in human T cells (Holling et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B30" href="#B30">2002</a>; Wong et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B91" href="#B91">2002</a>). Because of their crucial role in the immune response, the genes encoding MHC-I and MHC-II molecules are tightly regulated at the transcriptional level both by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms.
