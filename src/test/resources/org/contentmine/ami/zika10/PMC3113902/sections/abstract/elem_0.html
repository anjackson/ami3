      <p>Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I and MHC-II molecules play an essential role
         in the immune response to pathogens by virtue of their ability to present peptides
         to CD8
         <span>+</span> and CD4
         <span>+</span> T cells, respectively. Given this critical role, 
         <span>MHC-I</span> and 
         <span>MHC-II</span> genes are regulated in a tight fashion at the transcriptional level by a variety
         of transcription factors that interact with conserved cis-acting regulatory promoter
         elements. In addition to the activities of these regulatory factors, modification
         of chromatin also plays an essential role in the efficient transcription of these
         genes to meet with local requirement for an effective immune response. The focus of
         this review is on the transcription factors that interact with conserved cis-acting
         promoter elements and the epigenetic mechanisms that modulate induced and constitutive
         expression of these 
         <span>MHC</span> genes.
