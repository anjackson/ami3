 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Class II transactivator exerts its transactivating function through protein–protein interactions with the components of the MHC-enhanceosome bound to the proximal SXY regulatory module in MHC promoters (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a>; Masternak et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B50" href="#B50">2000</a>; Zhu et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B95" href="#B95">2000</a>; Jabrane-Ferrat et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B33" href="#B33">2003</a>). This interaction of CIITA with the MHC-enhanceosome allows for the subsequent recruitment of the lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) p300 (KAT3b)/CREB binding protein (CBP or KAT3a) and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF or KAT2b), which promote transcription of 
  <span class="italic">MHC-I</span> and 
  <span class="italic">MHC-II</span> genes by providing a more open chromatin structure (Kretsovali et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B41" href="#B41">1998</a>; Fontes et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B13" href="#B13">1999</a>; Spilianakis et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B77" href="#B77">2000</a>; Gobin et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B21" href="#B21">2001</a>). Furthermore, CIITA also recruits the co-activator-associated arginine methyltransferase-1/protein arginine 
  <span class="italic">N</span>-methyltransferase 4 (CARM1/PRMT4; Zika and Ting, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B98" href="#B98">2005</a>; Zika et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B96" href="#B96">2005</a>; Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a>). Besides acting as a platform for recruitment of KAT activities, CIITA itself contains intrinsic KAT activity. The CIITA-mediated transactivation of MHC promoters was found to rely on this intrinsic KAT activity, which maps to a region in its N-terminus (Raval et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B71" href="#B71">2001</a>). This KAT activity of CIITA is regulated by its C-terminal GTP-binding domain and is stimulated by GTP (Raval et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B71" href="#B71">2001</a>). Interestingly, the CIITA KAT activity was found to bypass TATA box binding protein (TBP)-associated factor 250 kDa (TAF
  <sub>II</sub>250) in MHC-I promoter activation (Raval et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B71" href="#B71">2001</a>). Moreover, acetylation of CIITA itself by CBP and/or PCAF at specific lysine residues within the bipartite nuclear localization signal in the amino-terminal region of CIITA governs its nuclear accumulation (Spilianakis et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B77" href="#B77">2000</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Class II transactivator also interacts with histone deacetylases (HDACs), which were found to interfere with CIITA function. These activities that acetylate/deacetylate lysine residues act as molecular switches for CIITA-mediated transcriptional activation/silencing of 
  <span class="italic">MHC</span> genes. In this respect, it was found that HDAC1 and HDAC2 interfere in the transcriptional transactivation function of CIITA following IFNγ induction (Zika et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B97" href="#B97">2003</a>; Kong et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B37" href="#B37">2009</a>). In mice the HDAC1/HDAC2-associated repressor SIN3 homolog A (mSin3A) amplifies this inhibition in CIITA function (Zika et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B97" href="#B97">2003</a>). HDAC2 has the potential to deacetylate CIITA through its interaction with CIITA (Kong et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B37" href="#B37">2009</a>). This results in targeting of CIITA to the proteasomal degradation machinery and decreased interaction of CIITA with the RFX component RFX5 (Kong et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B37" href="#B37">2009</a>). Together, these observations reveal that these HDAC activities affect CIITA function on the one hand by disrupting assembly of the MHC-enhanceosome, while on the other hand they interfere in CIITA interactions with the MHC-enhanceosome. The switch/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) ATPase Brahma-related gene-1 (BRG-1) also associates with CIITA and is required for the CIITA-mediated induction of 
  <span class="italic">MHC-II</span> genes (Mudhasani and Fontes, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B60" href="#B60">2002</a>). The association of CIITA and BRG-1 suggest that the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex is recruited by CIITA to MHC-II promoters to control transcription of 
  <span class="italic">MHC-II</span> genes. The ATPase Sug 1, a component of the 19S proteasome (19S P) complex, was found to be involved in increased levels of acetylation at MHC-II promoters and appeared to be essential for CIITA stability and 
  <span class="italic">MHC-II</span> expression (Bhat et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B4" href="#B4">2008</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B2" href="#B2">2010a</a>; Koues et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B38" href="#B38">2008</a>). More recently, another subunit of the 19S proteosome complex, the ATPase S6a (S6′/Tat-binding protein 1), was found to be crucial for regulating cytokine-inducible transcription of CIITA thereby indirectly modulation 
  <span class="italic">MHC-II</span> transcription (Truax et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B82" href="#B82">2010</a>). Other activities involved monoubiquitination of CIITA, which was shown to stabilize CIITA at MHC-II promoters (Bhat et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B3" href="#B3">2010b</a>). In addition MLL/COMPASS subunits, which are involved in establishing active histone H3-K4 methylation marks, were found also to be recruited to MHC-II promoters following IFNγ treatment of cells (Koues et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B39" href="#B39">2010</a>; Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a>).
