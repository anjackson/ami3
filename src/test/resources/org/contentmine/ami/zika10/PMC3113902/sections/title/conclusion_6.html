      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Constitutive and induced transcription of 
         <span>MHC-I</span> and 
         <span>MHC-II</span> genes is mediated by a set of conserved regulatory elements in their promoters and
         interacting transcription factors of which the SXY-module is shared by both sets of
         genes. CIITA plays an essential role in the control of constitutive and induced 
         <span>MHC-II</span> gene transcription through its interaction with the MHC-enhanceosome bound to the
         conserved SXY-module in MHC-II promoters. When bound to the MHC-enhanceosome, CIITA
         acts as a platform recruiting various activities involved in histone acetylation/deacetylation
         and methylation. CIITA is also central to recruitment of more general chromatin remodeling
         activities and long-range chromatin interactions of MHC-II promoters with distal elements.
         These activities mediated by CIITA provide strict control of transcription of these
         important immune genes. An additional level of transcriptional control for 
         <span>MHC-II</span> gene expression is at the level of 
         <span>MHC2TA</span>, the gene encoding CIITA, which is also tightly regulated by both genetic and epigenetic
         mechanisms. Because of the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the transcriptional
         control of 
         <span>MHC</span> genes, deviations in these epigenetic mechanisms as observed under pathological conditions
         such as in cancer and autoimmune disease might provide an opportunity for pharmacological
         interference targeting the enzymes that modify DNA and histones.
