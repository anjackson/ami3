      <p>In China in 2010, a disease outbreak in egg-laying ducks was associated with a flavivirus.
         The virus was isolated and partially sequenced. The isolate exhibited 87%â€“91% identity
         with strains of Tembusu virus, a mosquito-borne flavivirus of the Ntaya virus group.
         These findings demonstrate emergence of Tembusu virus in ducks.
