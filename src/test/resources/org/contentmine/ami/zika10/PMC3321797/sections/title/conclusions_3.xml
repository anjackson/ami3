 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have demonstrated the presence of a mosquito-borne flavivirus in ducks. On the basis of criteria for species of the members of the genus 
  <span class="italic">Flavivirus</span> (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>) and phylogenetic analysis, we consider the isolate to belong to a new genotype of TMUV.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we found TMUV-specific RNA in 63.5% samples from diseased ducks in different provinces. In particular, it was found in 14 (93.3%) of 15 theca folliculus samples, suggesting that reproductive tissues may be a major site for viral persistence, replication, or both. Experimental infections further confirmed that TMUV can be reisolated from theca folliculi. These results suggested that TMUV may be the causative agent of duck hemorrhagic ovaritis.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because TMUV belongs to the mosquito-borne virus cluster of flaviviruses, mosquitoes might be involved in the spread of this virus. Detection of the virus in cloacal swab samples suggests probable horizontal transmission through ingestion or inhalation of feces-contaminated material.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">TMUV was originally isolated from mosquitoes of the genus 
  <span class="italic">Culex</span>, but the disease associated with TMUV infection was not known. However, a chick-origin TMUV isolate, originally named Sitiawan virus, can cause encephalitis and retarded growth in broiler chicks (

  </a>). In conclusion, this study shows that duck-origin TMUV is highly pathogenic for Pekin ducks, Cherry Valley Pekin ducks, and Shaoxing ducks.
