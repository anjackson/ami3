      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the outbreak, we examined 11 diseased ducks (7 Pekin ducks, 3 Cherry Valley
         Pekin ducks, and 1 Shaoxing duck) from 5 duck farms in 4 provinces. At necropsy, viscera
         samples (e.g., brain, heart, liver, spleen, lung, theca folliculi) were collected
         and placed in 10% buffered formalin. Sections were embedded in paraffin and stained
         with hematoxylin and eosin. The theca folliculi from each duck were also used for
         virus isolation or detection by PCR.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main pathologic changes observed consistently in almost all diseased ducks were
         found in the ovaries: hyperemia, hemorrhage, degeneration, distortion, macrophage
         and lymphocyte infiltration, and hyperplasia; in the liver, interstitial inflammation
         was found in the portal area (
         <a>Figure 1</a>, panels A–C). On the basis of these changes, the disease was designated duck hemorrhagic
         ovaritis.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After samples underwent several rounds of screening and identification attempts, we
         concluded that a new virus infection was the most likely cause of the disease. One
         virus strain, designated YY5, was isolated from the Shaoxing duck after inoculation
         of clarified theca folliculus suspension into the allantoic cavities of 9-day-old
         specific pathogen–free chicken embryos. The embryos died 72–120 hours after inoculation,
         and severe cutaneous hemorrhages were observed.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus has been shown to cause paralysis
         in Pekin ducks (
         <a><span>1</span></a>), we performed EEE virus–specific nested reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (
         <a><span>2</span></a>) to detect the isolate. RNA was extracted by using the TranZol RNA Extraction Kit
         (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). The primer pairs used to amplify the E2 gene of
         EEE virus (EEE-4 and cEEE-7, EEE-5 and cEEE-6) have been described (
         <a><span>2</span></a>). A clear PCR product (268 bp) resulted and was then sequenced; the deduced amino
         acid sequence was compared with other sequences by using a BLASTP (
         <span>http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi</span>) search in GenBank. Unexpectedly, a 221-nt sequence (GenBank accession no. HQ641388)
         was shown to encode the nonstructural (NS) 1 protein of flavivirus, which exhibited
         73%–85% identity to flaviviruses in the Ntaya virus and Japanese encephalitis virus
         groups, such as Bagaza virus (GenBank accession no. ACG60714 [
         <a><span>3</span></a>],) and St. Louis encephalitis virus (GenBank accession no. ABN11829 [
         <span>4</span>]). The result demonstrated the possible presence of a flavivirus in ducks.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To further confirm flavivirus as the causative agent of duck hemorrhagic ovaritis,
         we used PCR to test the isolate and clinical samples with forward primer Usu5454f
         (5′-ATGGATGAAGCYCATTTCAC-3′) (
         <a><span>5</span></a>) and a newly designed reverse primer 5861R (5′-CCAAAGTTGGCYCCCATCTC-3′). The primers
         were located in the conserved regions of the NS3 sequences of Bagaza virus, St. Louis
         encephalitis virus, and Usutu virus (
         <a><span>3</span></a>–
         <a><span>5</span></a>) and were predicted to produce an ≈400-bp amplicon. The reaction conditions were
         as follows: 5 min at 94°C; followed by 38 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 40 s,
         annealing at 47°C for 35 s, and extension at 72°C for 1 min; and a final extension
         of 72°C for 10 min. RT-PCR was optimized by using the following controls, including
         nucleic acids extracted from theca folliculi of healthy Pekin ducks: avian influenza
         virus, Newcastle disease virus, egg drop syndrome virus, anatid herpesvirus 1, Muscovy
         duck parvovirus, goose parvovirus, duck reovirus, goose reovirus, duck hepatitis A
         virus, duck astrovirus, duck circovirus, and goose hemorrhagic polyomavirus.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All 11 theca folliculus samples and the isolate were positive for flavivirus by RT-PCR,
         which was confirmed by amplicon sequencing. The 367-nt sequence (GenBank accession
         no. HQ641389) of part of the NS3 genomic region obtained from the isolate was 66%–77%
         identical to the corresponding sequence of viruses in the Ntaya virus and Japanese
         encephalitis virus groups. The amplicon sequences from the 11 theca folliculus samples
         shared 98%–100% identity with the YY5 isolate. PCR testing of another 52 samples from
         diseased ducks from the 4 provinces detected flavivirus-specific RNA in 29 samples.
         Overall, 40 (63.5%) of 63 samples were positive for flavivirus. Flavivirus-specific
         RNA was most frequently detected in theca folliculi, followed by intestinal mucosa,
         uterus, spleen, trachea, cloaca (swab), and liver (
         <a>Table</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Subsequently, the YY5 isolate was injected intramuscularly into nine 55-week-old Pekin
         ducks and ten 30-week-old Shaoxing ducks. At day 4 postinoculation, the pathologic
         changes were reproduced in these experimentally infected ducks. The flavivirus RNA
         was detected by NS3-based RT-PCR, and the virus was again isolated from theca folliculi.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate the genetic relationship of the isolate with flaviviruses, we obtained
         the genomic sequence of a 1,035-bp segment at the 3′ terminus of the NS5 gene (GenBank
         accession no. HQ641390) from strain YY5 by RT-PCR and primers FU1 and cFD3 as described
         (
         <a><span>6</span></a>). Phylogenetic analysis showed that YY5 was more closely related to TMUV than to
         other flaviviruses (
         <a>Figure 2</a>). Comparative sequence analysis showed that YY5 was 87%–91% identical to different
         strains of TMUV; therefore, we classified the flavivirus isolated from ducks as a
         new genotype of TMUV, a mosquito-borne flavivirus of the Ntaya virus group.
