         rabbits

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PBMCs were isolated from whole blood samples using separation media (Lympholyte-Mammal;
         Cedarlane) according to the manufacturer's instruction and stained and analysed immediately.
         For single colour flow cytometry, 5×10
         <span>5</span> PBMCs were distributed as 50 µl aliquots in 1.5 ml tubes and kept on ice. Anti-rabbit
         IgG FITC was obtained from AbD Serotec (Düsseldorf, Germany). Anti-rabbit IgM biotin
         was from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, USA). FITC labelled streptavidin and anti-mouse
         IgM phycoerythrin (PE) conjugate were from Invitrogen (Germany). The monoclonal antibody
         RACT30A, which detects an unidentified rabbit B-cell surface marker 
         <a>[25]</a>, was obtained from VMRD (Pullman, USA). The PE-labelled antibody (clone HM47, BD
         Pharmingen), which binds the highly conserved intracellular domain of human CD79a
         (component of the B cell receptor) cross-reacts with rabbit CD79a 
         <a>[26]</a>. For intracellular staining, PBMCs were fixed with Cytofix and permeabilised with
         Perm/Wash (BD Pharmingen) as mentioned in the instructions from the manufacturer.
         PBMC aliquots were incubated with 50 µl fluorochrome labelled mAbs or streptavidin
         in PBS for 30 min under rotation at 4°C in the dark. PBMCs were washed twice with
         ice cold PBS, resuspended in ice cold PBS and subjected to FACS analysis. For all
         surface staining, propidium iodide at a concentration of 5 µg/ml (BD Pharmingen, USA)
         was added prior to FACS analysis to discriminate between live and dead cells. 10,000
         live PBMCs were analysed per sample. A FACSAria flow cytometer equipped with a computer
         and FACSDiva software (Becton Dickinson) was used to collect and analyse the data,
         FACS gates used are shown in each panel of 
         <a>Figure 2</a>.
