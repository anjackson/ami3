 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the failure of other techniques, we wished to investigate whether ZFN technology offers a practical means of targeted gene inactivation, addition or replacement in the rabbit. The immunoglobulin M locus was chosen as a suitable target because inactivation of endogenous immunoglobulins is a necessary first step for the production of human antibodies in a human immunoglobulin transgenic rabbit model.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The kinetics of ZFN activity in fertilized oocytes should be as rapid as possible, preferably before the first cleavage, to ensure that ZFN induced mutations are included in the germ line. ZFN activity should also be transient, to avoid possible accumulation of additional mutations in the developing embryo. In pilot experiments we microinjected EGFP mRNA diluted in either EDTA solution (0.1 mM, pH 8), or Tris/EDTA buffer (5 mM/0.1 mM, pH 7.5) into one of the two pronuclei or the cytoplasm of fertilized rabbit oocytes. Microinjection was verified in each oocyte by observing slight swelling of the pronucleus, or disturbance in the cytoplasm caused by solution streaming from the capillary. Of the oocytes injected into the pronucleus, only those injected with Tris/EDTA survived and developed further. Following cytoplasmic injection, survival and development was better in embryos injected with EDTA. Cytoplasmic microinjection of mRNA diluted in EDTA also led to earlier onset and higher EGFP expression at lower concentrations than pronuclear microinjection of mRNA in Tris/EDTA (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021045.s004" href="#pone.0021045.s004">Table S1</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then examined technical parameters that could affect embryo viability and the levels of ZFN activity. These included ZFN mRNA concentration, site of microinjection (cytoplasm or pronucleus), and 
   <span class="italic">in vitro</span> polyadenylation of mRNA. Injected embryos were cultured 
   <span class="italic">in vitro</span> and monitored visually for development up to blastocyst stage. Exons 1 or 2 of the IgM locus were then amplified from blastocysts by nested PCR. Results indicated that: the optimal mRNA concentration range was between 3 to 6 ng/µl; microinjection of non-polyadenylated mRNA did not lead to effective mutagenesis; and microinjection into the pronucleus did not lead to effective mutagenesis (shown for exon 1 in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021045.s005" href="#pone.0021045.s005">Table S2</a>). For gene inactivation experiments we therefore microinjected a 1∶1 mixture of polyadenylated mRNAs coding for the two components of a ZFN heterodimer, diluted to a total of 3 to 5 ng/µl in 0.1 mM EDTA, into the cytoplasm of pronuclear stage fertilized rabbit oocytes.

Sequence analysis of the IgM locus in these 34 rabbits revealed that six animals carried mutations in exon 1, and four had mutations in exon 2. Eighteen stillborn rabbits were also analyzed. Mutations at the IgM locus were detected in six animals (

DNA sequence analysis of live and stillborn rabbits revealed a variety of mutations at the IgM locus, including deletions of 1 to 25 bp, single base insertions, and combinations of small deletions and insertions. Results are summarized in

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the ten rabbits identified as carrying ZFN induced mutant IgM alleles, eight (four males and four females) survived to sexual maturity and were used as founders to produce a F1 generation. Seven F0 rabbits transmitted mutant IgM alleles at frequencies ranging from 1.3% to 50% (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0021045-t001" href="#pone-0021045-t001">Table 1</a>). Among these, one male (22826) and one female (22821) both carried two independent mutations. The female failed to pass on either mutation to the next generation, but the male transmitted both mutations at a similar rate, suggesting that founder rabbits had different degrees of mosaicism.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">IgM knockout rabbits are IgM and IgG deficient</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the immune response, the first antibodies to appear are of the IgM class. IgG, IgA, or IgE are then generated from IgM via class-switch recombination. Lack of IgM should therefore result in the absence of other isotypes. To determine if this was the case in our rabbits, we generated IgM knockout rabbits by breeding ZFN-treated founders and measured both IgM and IgG in serum.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Δ1 (male founder 22826) and Δ7 (female founder 22830) mutations in exon 1 both result in frameshifts in the IgM coding region and were predicted to disrupt expression of full-length protein. The founder male 22826 was intercrossed with the founder female 22830 to generate Δ1/Δ7 compound heterozygous animals. Three mutated F1 animals were obtained, one carrying the Δ1 mutation, one carrying the Δ7 mutation, and one Δ1/Δ7 compound heterozygote. The Δ7 mutation was also bred to homozygosity in an F2 generation. Serum IgM and IgG levels in these animals were determined by ELISA at 10 weeks of age. IgM and IgG levels were similar to wild type in Δ1 and Δ7 heterozygotes, but were undetectable in Δ1/Δ7 and Δ7/Δ7 rabbits (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0021045-t002" href="#pone-0021045-t002">Table 2</a>). The peripheral B-cell population in Δ1/Δ7 and Δ7/Δ7 rabbits was characterized by FACS analysis; only ∼0.1% of PBMCs stained positive for surface IgM (sIgM), and sIgG positive PBMCs were completely absent. In contrast, control wild type animals showed 21.4% of PBMC positive for sIgM and 0.7% positive for sIgG, typical for rabbit blood. A rabbit pan B-cell specific antibody 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021045-Davis1" href="#pone.0021045-Davis1">[25]</a> also revealed significantly fewer stained cells in the Δ1/Δ7 animal (1.5%) than in wild type (22.9%), see

   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0021045-t002" href="#pone-0021045-t002">Table 2</a>). Thus, the Δ15 mutation does not appear to affect functional IgM expression or B-cell development.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results show that ZFN-induced knockout alleles of the rabbit IgM gene transmit normally through the germline, and in homozygous form result in animals that are IgM- and IgG-deficient, but otherwise do not display obvious phenotypic abnormalities.

   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0021045-t003" href="#pone-0021045-t003">Table 3</a>. Since ZFN mRNAs are most effective when injected into the cytoplasm, but IgME1 targeting vector DNA must be located in the nucleus to serve as the donor during homology-directed repair, we employed a two-step microinjection procedure similar to that described by Meyer et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021045-Meyer1" href="#pone.0021045-Meyer1">[23]</a>. A portion of the mRNA/DNA mixture was first injected into a pronucleus to locate the vector DNA with the nuclear DNA. Then, on removing the injection needle, a second dose was injected into the cytoplasm to enable translation of ZFN mRNA. Microinjected oocytes were cultured to blastocyst stage and a total of 242 blastocysts were analyzed by PCR for targeted gene replacement events. Correct gene editing was detected in three blastocysts, as judged by the presence of a diagnostic 1.758 kb PCR product spanning the 5′ junction of the target site, see

Combined data for all mRNA and targeting vector DNA concentrations indicated an overall rate of 1.2% targeted sequence replacement, but efficiency at the most effective mRNA/DNA concentrations was higher (17% at 9 ng/µl ZFN mRNA plus 10–15 ng/µl IgME1 DNA). Positive blastocysts were also screened for the presence of an intact IgM exon 1 by PCR. All gave a positive result, indicating that targeting had occurred at just one IgM allele.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oocytes were then injected with 9 ng/µl ZFN 18255/18257 mRNA plus 10 ng/µl IgME1 DNA, and transferred to recipients. Seventeen fetuses were removed at day 15 of gestation and analyzed. All showed normal development, and examination of the uterine horns showed no evidence of degenerate or absorbed conceptuses. DNA was prepared from each fetus and screened by PCR. Three fetuses (2, 7 and 9) showed amplification of a 1.758 kb product across the 5′ junction and a 1.683 kb fragment across the 3′ junction of the target site, consistent with replacement of IgM exon 1 with the PGK neo cassette by homologous recombination, see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021045-g004" href="#pone-0021045-g004">Figure 4</a>. The identity of the 5′ PCR product was confirmed by restriction digestion, see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021045-g004" href="#pone-0021045-g004">Figure 4</a>. In addition, the DNA sequence of the 5′ PCR product from fetus 7 was determined and found to be identical to that predicted for the targeted locus, see 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021045.s002" href="#pone.0021045.s002">Figure S2</a>. Southern hybridization analysis was carried out using genomic DNA from the three PCR positive and five PCR negative fetuses. The Southern blotting scheme is outlined in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021045-g003" href="#pone-0021045-g003">Figure 3</a> and results shown in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021045.s003" href="#pone.0021045.s003">Figure S3</a>. Each of the PCR positive fetuses showed a diagnostic restriction fragment spanning the 3′ junction of the target site, consistent with targeted replacement at the first exon, and also a fragment corresponding to a wild type IgM allele. The five negative fetuses showed only the wild type allele.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, our data show efficient ZFN-induced gene disruption and homology-directed sequence replacement through microinjection in rabbit oocytes. We have obtained the first rabbits genetically engineered at a specific endogenous locus, the immunoglobulin M locus.</p>
