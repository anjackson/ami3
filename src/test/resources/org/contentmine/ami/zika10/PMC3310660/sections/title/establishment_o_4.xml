 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The kinetics of ZFN activity in fertilized oocytes should be as rapid as possible, preferably before the first cleavage, to ensure that ZFN induced mutations are included in the germ line. ZFN activity should also be transient, to avoid possible accumulation of additional mutations in the developing embryo. In pilot experiments we microinjected EGFP mRNA diluted in either EDTA solution (0.1 mM, pH 8), or Tris/EDTA buffer (5 mM/0.1 mM, pH 7.5) into one of the two pronuclei or the cytoplasm of fertilized rabbit oocytes. Microinjection was verified in each oocyte by observing slight swelling of the pronucleus, or disturbance in the cytoplasm caused by solution streaming from the capillary. Of the oocytes injected into the pronucleus, only those injected with Tris/EDTA survived and developed further. Following cytoplasmic injection, survival and development was better in embryos injected with EDTA. Cytoplasmic microinjection of mRNA diluted in EDTA also led to earlier onset and higher EGFP expression at lower concentrations than pronuclear microinjection of mRNA in Tris/EDTA (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then examined technical parameters that could affect embryo viability and the levels of ZFN activity. These included ZFN mRNA concentration, site of microinjection (cytoplasm or pronucleus), and

  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> and monitored visually for development up to blastocyst stage. Exons 1 or 2 of the IgM locus were then amplified from blastocysts by nested PCR. Results indicated that: the optimal mRNA concentration range was between 3 to 6 ng/µl; microinjection of non-polyadenylated mRNA did not lead to effective mutagenesis; and microinjection into the pronucleus did not lead to effective mutagenesis (shown for exon 1 in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021045.s005" href="#pone.0021045.s005">Table S2</a>). For gene inactivation experiments we therefore microinjected a 1∶1 mixture of polyadenylated mRNAs coding for the two components of a ZFN heterodimer, diluted to a total of 3 to 5 ng/µl in 0.1 mM EDTA, into the cytoplasm of pronuclear stage fertilized rabbit oocytes.
