 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DNA was prepared from blastocysts by lysis in 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl
  <sub>2</sub>, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% NP40, 0.5% Tween20 and 100 µg proteinase K; or by lysis in 8 µl 50 mM NaOH (10 min 95°C; 2 µl 1 M Tris, pH 7.5 then added for neutralization); and from fetal tissue or ear biopsies of offspring by standard methods. Rabbit Cµ was amplified by PCR using primer pairs E1.1f (

  <div content-type="gene" class="named-content">CTC GGA GGA CAT GGA CAC GTT CTT ATC</div>) for exon 2. Nested PCRs from blastocysts were performed using the two primer pairs specific for exon 1 or 2 consecutively. PCR products containing mutated sequences detected by DNA sequence chromatography were cloned into the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) for DNA sequencing of ZFN-induced mutations.
