      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rabbits are important laboratory animals, widely used in many areas of biomedical
         research, including the production of antibodies and recombinant proteins. Rabbit
         models have contributed to the understanding of human diseases and the development
         of therapeutic compounds, devices and techniques. However it has not been possible
         to engineer precise genetic alterations in rabbits because they have so far been refractory
         to the two key enabling technologies; (I) rabbit embryonic stem (ES) cells capable
         of contributing to the germ line have yet to be derived, and (II) rabbits are particularly
         difficult to produce by somatic cell nuclear transfer 
         <a>[1]</a>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The power and facility of gene targeting in ES cells has made the mouse by far the
         most intensively studied mammal 
         <a>[2]</a>. Extending gene targeting to other species would deepen our understanding of gene
         function and further the development of many valuable biomedical applications, but
         the lack of fully functional ES cells has been a long-standing obstacle.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nuclear transfer from cultured somatic cells (SCNT) was developed to circumvent the
         requirement for ES cells to generate gene-targeted animals. This is, however, technically
         difficult, and more than ten years since our first demonstration of targeting 
         <span>COL1A1</span> in sheep 
         <a>[3]</a>, there are still few other examples: 
         <span>PRNP</span> in sheep, cattle and goats 
         <a>[4]</a>–
         <a>[6]</a>, 
         <span>GGTA1</span> in pigs 
         <a>[7]</a>, 
         <a>[8]</a>, 
         <span>IGH</span> in cattle and pigs 
         <a>[5]</a>, 
         <a>[9]</a>, 
         <a>[10]</a>, 
         <span>IGKC</span> in pigs 
         <a>[11]</a> and 
         <span>CFTR</span> in pigs 
         <a>[12]</a>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) are new tools that promise to radically simplify gene
         knockout and targeted gene replacement. An appropriately designed ZFN can create a
         double-strand break at a single predetermined site in the genomic DNA of an organism.
         In eukaryotes, double-strand break repair pathways often create small insertions and
         deletions at the break site, a useful means of inactivating genes of interest (for
         review, see Urnov et al. 
         <a>[13]</a>). ZFN cleavage can also stimulate homology-directed genetic exchange between an episomal
         donor construct and a chromosomal locus, as first demonstrated for a native locus
         in Drosophila 
         <a>[14]</a> and for endogenous loci in human cells 
         <a>[15]</a>–
         <a>[17]</a>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A particularly promising approach is ZFN-mediated gene knockout directly in early
         embryos, because it offers a one-step method without any cell intermediate, as shown
         for zebrafish 
         <a>[18]</a>, 
         <a>[19]</a>, rats 
         <a>[20]</a>, 
         <a>[21]</a> and mice 
         <a>[22]</a>. Most recently, ZFN-mediated gene targeting by homologous recombination has been
         achieved in mice and rats 
         <a>[23]</a>, 
         <a>[24]</a>. However ZFNs are likely to make their greatest impact in species where classical
         means of gene targeting are not available. Here we demonstrate that ZFNs enable precise
         genetic engineering in a particularly intractable species.
