 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then tested if ZFN-mediated targeted sequence replacement was feasible directly in the oocyte. A gene targeting vector, IgME1, was designed to replace IgM exon 1 with a PGK neo cassette, providing ∼1.9 kb of novel sequence. The strategy is illustrated in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021045-g003" href="#pone-0021045-g003">Figure 3</a>; the full sequence of the gene-targeting vector is shown in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021045.s002" href="#pone.0021045.s002">Figure S2</a>. Although the presence of the PGK neo gene was used for screening, no antibiotic selection was used to enrich for neo-positive embryos.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mixtures of 
  <span class="italic">MluI</span> linearised IgME1 DNA (concentrations ranging from 5 to 15 ng/µl) and ZFN 18255/18257 mRNAs (concentrations ranging from 3 to 9 ng/µl of each) were injected into pronuclear stage fertilized oocytes, see 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0021045-t003" href="#pone-0021045-t003">Table 3</a>. Since ZFN mRNAs are most effective when injected into the cytoplasm, but IgME1 targeting vector DNA must be located in the nucleus to serve as the donor during homology-directed repair, we employed a two-step microinjection procedure similar to that described by Meyer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021045-Meyer1" href="#pone.0021045-Meyer1">[23]</a>. A portion of the mRNA/DNA mixture was first injected into a pronucleus to locate the vector DNA with the nuclear DNA. Then, on removing the injection needle, a second dose was injected into the cytoplasm to enable translation of ZFN mRNA. Microinjected oocytes were cultured to blastocyst stage and a total of 242 blastocysts were analyzed by PCR for targeted gene replacement events. Correct gene editing was detected in three blastocysts, as judged by the presence of a diagnostic 1.758 kb PCR product spanning the 5′ junction of the target site, see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021045-g004" href="#pone-0021045-g004">Figure 4</a>. Data summarized in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0021045-t003" href="#pone-0021045-t003">Table 3</a> show that concentrations of ZFN mRNA slightly higher than those used for mutagenesis were most effective in driving targeted sequence replacement. Combined data for all mRNA and targeting vector DNA concentrations indicated an overall rate of 1.2% targeted sequence replacement, but efficiency at the most effective mRNA/DNA concentrations was higher (17% at 9 ng/µl ZFN mRNA plus 10–15 ng/µl IgME1 DNA). Positive blastocysts were also screened for the presence of an intact IgM exon 1 by PCR. All gave a positive result, indicating that targeting had occurred at just one IgM allele.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oocytes were then injected with 9 ng/µl ZFN 18255/18257 mRNA plus 10 ng/µl IgME1 DNA, and transferred to recipients. Seventeen fetuses were removed at day 15 of gestation and analyzed. All showed normal development, and examination of the uterine horns showed no evidence of degenerate or absorbed conceptuses. DNA was prepared from each fetus and screened by PCR. Three fetuses (2, 7 and 9) showed amplification of a 1.758 kb product across the 5′ junction and a 1.683 kb fragment across the 3′ junction of the target site, consistent with replacement of IgM exon 1 with the PGK neo cassette by homologous recombination, see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021045-g004" href="#pone-0021045-g004">Figure 4</a>. The identity of the 5′ PCR product was confirmed by restriction digestion, see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021045-g004" href="#pone-0021045-g004">Figure 4</a>. In addition, the DNA sequence of the 5′ PCR product from fetus 7 was determined and found to be identical to that predicted for the targeted locus, see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021045.s002" href="#pone.0021045.s002">Figure S2</a>. Southern hybridization analysis was carried out using genomic DNA from the three PCR positive and five PCR negative fetuses. The Southern blotting scheme is outlined in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0021045-g003" href="#pone-0021045-g003">Figure 3</a> and results shown in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0021045.s003" href="#pone.0021045.s003">Figure S3</a>. Each of the PCR positive fetuses showed a diagnostic restriction fragment spanning the 3′ junction of the target site, consistent with targeted replacement at the first exon, and also a fragment corresponding to a wild type IgM allele. The five negative fetuses showed only the wild type allele.
