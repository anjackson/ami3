      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">IgM knockout rabbits are IgM and IgG deficient</div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the immune response, the first antibodies to appear are of the IgM class. IgG,
         IgA, or IgE are then generated from IgM via class-switch recombination. Lack of IgM
         should therefore result in the absence of other isotypes. To determine if this was
         the case in our rabbits, we generated IgM knockout rabbits by breeding ZFN-treated
         founders and measured both IgM and IgG in serum.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Δ1 (male founder 22826) and Δ7 (female founder 22830) mutations in exon 1 both
         result in frameshifts in the IgM coding region and were predicted to disrupt expression
         of full-length protein. The founder male 22826 was intercrossed with the founder female
         22830 to generate Δ1/Δ7 compound heterozygous animals. Three mutated F1 animals were
         obtained, one carrying the Δ1 mutation, one carrying the Δ7 mutation, and one Δ1/Δ7
         compound heterozygote. The Δ7 mutation was also bred to homozygosity in an F2 generation.
         Serum IgM and IgG levels in these animals were determined by ELISA at 10 weeks of
         age. IgM and IgG levels were similar to wild type in Δ1 and Δ7 heterozygotes, but
         were undetectable in Δ1/Δ7 and Δ7/Δ7 rabbits (
         <a>Table 2</a>). The peripheral B-cell population in Δ1/Δ7 and Δ7/Δ7 rabbits was characterized by
         FACS analysis; only ∼0.1% of PBMCs stained positive for surface IgM (sIgM), and sIgG
         positive PBMCs were completely absent. In contrast, control wild type animals showed
         21.4% of PBMC positive for sIgM and 0.7% positive for sIgG, typical for rabbit blood.
         A rabbit pan B-cell specific antibody 
         <a>[25]</a> also revealed significantly fewer stained cells in the Δ1/Δ7 animal (1.5%) than in
         wild type (22.9%), see 
         <a>Figure 2 A and B</a>. A second and well-defined B cell-specific marker is CD79a, constituting a part of
         the B cell receptor. Using an antibody that binds to the highly conserved intracellular
         domain of CD79a 
         <a>[26]</a>, no B cell receptor positive cells could be detected in Δ1/Δ7 and Δ7/Δ7 rabbits,
         whereas 41.4% of all PBMCs were marked as B cells in control animals (
         <a>Figure 2 C</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The founder 22826 (Δ1 mutation) was also crossed with founder 25035, which carries
         a Δ15 deletion in exon 2 predicted to result in an in-frame loss of 5 amino acids.
         Serum analysis of Δ1/Δ15 F1 offspring revealed normal levels of IgM and IgG (
         <a>Table 2</a>). Thus, the Δ15 mutation does not appear to affect functional IgM expression or B-cell
         development.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results show that ZFN-induced knockout alleles of the rabbit IgM gene transmit
         normally through the germline, and in homozygous form result in animals that are IgM-
         and IgG-deficient, but otherwise do not display obvious phenotypic abnormalities.
         It remains to be elucidated what effect the loss of IgM and IgG has on overall immunological
         function in these rabbits.
