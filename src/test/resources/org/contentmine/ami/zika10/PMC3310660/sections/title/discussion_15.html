      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gene targeting in ES cells has propelled the mouse to the forefront of biomedical
         research. This is despite the fact that its small size limits the scope for many physiological
         investigations and the low blood volume precludes its use as a source of serum factors.
         Metabolic and physiological differences also limit the relevance of mice to some human
         diseases, e.g. cardiomyopathy 
         <a>[27]</a> or cystic fibrosis 
         <a>[12]</a>. Other mammals, notably rabbit and pig, are increasingly seen as valuable alternatives
         but there is a significant need for efficient methods of precise genetic engineering
         in these species. Here we describe a generally applicable protocol for targeted genome
         editing in the rabbit. ZFNs introduced into fertilized oocytes can mediate gene inactivation
         by DNA repair mutagenesis and also homology-directed targeted sequence replacement.
         The technique is a simple, efficient and practical means of establishing lines of
         precisely genetically engineered rabbits.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Like mice, rabbits have a short generation time, produce large numbers of offspring
         and can be raised under specific pathogen free conditions. They have long been an
         important research animal, and are an indispensible source of polyclonal and monoclonal
         antibodies 
         <a>[28]</a>, 
         <a>[29]</a>. Spontaneous mutant rabbit strains such as WHHL are widely used in the study of lipid
         metabolism and atherosclerosis 
         <a>[30]</a>. Pronuclear microinjection of DNA is as facile in rabbits as in mice, and transgenic
         rabbits have been generated as models for retinal degeneration 
         <a>[31]</a>, cardiomyopathy 
         <a>[32]</a>, inflammation 
         <a>[33]</a>, hyperlipidemia 
         <a>[34]</a> and for the evaluation of human vaccines 
         <a>[35]</a>. Rabbits have also been used for the production of pharmaceutical proteins in milk.
         However, until now the scope of genetic manipulations has been limited to gain-of-function
         changes by classical random transgenesis.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Human polyclonal antisera produced by hyperimmunisation of animals with a humanized
         immune system are potentially an extremely useful new class of therapeutic agents.
         The inactivation of the IgM locus and loss of endogenous IgM and IgG expression on
         B cells and in serum that we describe is an essential step in the modification of
         rabbits to produce human immunoglobulins. The expression of immunoglobulin transgenes
         has been described for pigs, chicken, and rabbits 
         <a>[36]</a>–
         <a>[38]</a>, and recently the inactivation of immunoglobulin genes in pigs was reported 
         <a>[10]</a>, 
         <a>[11]</a>. However, the inactivation of endogenous immunoglobulin genes in combination with
         addition of human immunoglobulin genes has so far only been achieved in mice and cattle
         
         <a>[9]</a>, 
         <a>[39]</a>–
         <a>[44]</a>. Experiments are now underway to achieve this in rabbits.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ZFN-mediated mutagenesis of the IgM locus in rabbit oocytes was efficient, yielding
         up to 30% mutant animals in the founder generation. Seven of eight founders passed
         on mutant alleles to their progeny. We also assessed whether ZFN-mediated targeted
         sequence replacement could be carried out directly in the oocyte without subsequent
         selection for the desired event, as recently described in mice 
         <a>[23]</a>. Our results show targeted sequence replacement in rabbit at a rate of up to 18%
         in fetuses. The frequency of ZFN mediated homologous recombination events we observed
         was therefore at least equal to that described in mouse (1.7–4.5%, Meyer et al. 
         <a>[23]</a>) and clearly higher than the rate of approximately 1 in 500 reported in mouse zygotes
         without ZFN 
         <a>[45]</a>. These results suggest that the technique should be generally applicable, opening
         the way for the full repertoire of sophisticated gene replacement and modification
         techniques developed in mouse ES cells. ZFN-mediated genome editing does not require
         expression at the targeted locus and our data show that regions of homology as short
         as 1 kb or less, easily obtained by PCR amplification, are sufficient for efficient
         targeted sequence replacement. With less than 2 kb of total homology, our IgM gene
         targeting vector was considerably shorter than those described by Meyer et al. 
         <a>[23]</a>, but similar to those used for ZFN-mediated gene targeting in human transformed 
         <a>[16]</a>, ES and iPS cells 
         <a>[46]</a>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rodents, rabbits and other mammals all have particular limitations and strengths for
         biomedical research and are best regarded as complementary. Parallel and comparative
         studies performed in more than one species will speed progress in disease research
         and provide more reliable evaluation of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
         Gene targeting in ES cells is established in mouse and now in rat 
         <a>[3]</a>, but has so far been elusive in rabbit. Our approach circumvents the need for ES
         cells or SCNT to carry out precise alterations in any gene, because ZFNs can be designed
         against any native locus of interest 
         <a>[13]</a>, 
         <a>[47]</a>. This achievement removes a major block to the development of genetically altered
         research models in those species where ES and SCNT technologies are not available.
         Furthermore, unlike ES cell-based methods, the desired genetic change can be introduced
         directly into the animal strain of choice, and heterozygous individuals obtained in
         the first generation. We are confident that this can be applied to other rabbit genes
         and other mammals, including important livestock species such as pigs. The possible
         applications are manifold.
