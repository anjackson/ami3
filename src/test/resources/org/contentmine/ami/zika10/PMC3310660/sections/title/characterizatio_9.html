      <div>Characterization of the peripheral B-cell compartment of mutant offspring from ZFN-treated
         rabbits by FACS analysis.
      </div>
      <p>A. The top panels show representative dot plot profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear
         cells (PBMCs) of a wild type rabbit stained with antibodies specific for surface IgM
         (left) and surface IgG (right). Lower panels show Δ1/Δ7 PBMCs stained with the same
         antibodies. B. The upper dot plot shows wild type PBMCs immunostained with RACT30A,
         an antibody that recognizes a rabbit B-cell specific surface protein 
         <a>[25]</a>. The lower panel shows Δ1/Δ7 PBMCs stained the same way. A and B: Only live PBMCs
         were included in these analyses. C. Dot plot profiles showing wild type (left) and
         Δ7/Δ7 (right) PBMCs, stained intracellularly for the B cell receptor component CD79a.
         The percentage of gated B cells (IgM
         <span>+</span>, IgG
         <span>+</span>, rabbit B cell marker
         <span>+</span>, or CD79a
         <span>+</span>) of all PBMCs is indicated in the upper right of each dot plot.
