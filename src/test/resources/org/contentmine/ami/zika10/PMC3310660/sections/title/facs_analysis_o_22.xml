 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PBMCs were isolated from whole blood samples using separation media (Lympholyte-Mammal; Cedarlane) according to the manufacturer's instruction and stained and analysed immediately. For single colour flow cytometry, 5×10
  <span class="sup">5</span> PBMCs were distributed as 50 µl aliquots in 1.5 ml tubes and kept on ice. Anti-rabbit IgG FITC was obtained from AbD Serotec (Düsseldorf, Germany). Anti-rabbit IgM biotin was from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, USA). FITC labelled streptavidin and anti-mouse IgM phycoerythrin (PE) conjugate were from Invitrogen (Germany). The monoclonal antibody RACT30A, which detects an unidentified rabbit B-cell surface marker 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021045-Davis1" href="#pone.0021045-Davis1">[25]</a>, was obtained from VMRD (Pullman, USA). The PE-labelled antibody (clone HM47, BD Pharmingen), which binds the highly conserved intracellular domain of human CD79a (component of the B cell receptor) cross-reacts with rabbit CD79a

For intracellular staining, PBMCs were fixed with Cytofix and permeabilised with Perm/Wash (BD Pharmingen) as mentioned in the instructions from the manufacturer. PBMC aliquots were incubated with 50 µl fluorochrome labelled mAbs or streptavidin in PBS for 30 min under rotation at 4°C in the dark. PBMCs were washed twice with ice cold PBS, resuspended in ice cold PBS and subjected to FACS analysis. For all surface staining, propidium iodide at a concentration of 5 µg/ml (BD Pharmingen, USA) was added prior to FACS analysis to discriminate between live and dead cells. 10,000 live PBMCs were analysed per sample. A FACSAria flow cytometer equipped with a computer and FACSDiva software (Becton Dickinson) was used to collect and analyse the data, FACS gates used are shown in each panel of
