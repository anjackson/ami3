<p class="p">Human polyclonal antisera produced by hyperimmunisation of animals with a humanized immune system are potentially an extremely useful new class of therapeutic agents. The inactivation of the IgM locus and loss of endogenous IgM and IgG expression on B cells and in serum that we describe is an essential step in the modification of rabbits to produce human immunoglobulins. The expression of immunoglobulin transgenes has been described for pigs, chicken, and rabbits
