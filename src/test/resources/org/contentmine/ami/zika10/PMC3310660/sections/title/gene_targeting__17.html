      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The vector IgME1, used for ZFN-mediated targeted replacement, comprised a 0.758 kb
         homologous arm extending upstream of IgM exon 1 on the 5′ side, and a 1.035 kb arm
         extending downstream of IgM exon 1 to the end of exon 3 on the 3′ side, separated
         by a PGK neo polyA cassette (see 
         <a>Figure 3</a> and 
         <a>Figure S2</a>). Homologous sequences were obtained by PCR from genomic DNA from a ZIKA rabbit.
