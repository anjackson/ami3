 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Animals used as oocyte donors for the gene inactivation experiments were homozogous Alicia/homozogous Basilea back-crossed for several generations onto the ZIKA background. Alicia (Ali) rabbits carry a natural deletion within the IgH locus 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021045-Knight1" href="#pone.0021045-Knight1">[48]</a> and homozygous Basilea (Bas) animals do not express IgÎº, due to a non-functional splice acceptor 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021045-Lamoyi1" href="#pone.0021045-Lamoyi1">[49]</a>. ZIKA rabbits were used as oocyte donors for the gene replacement experiments. Pronuclear stage fertilized oocytes were obtained by flushing oviducts 21 to 24 hrs from female rabbits superovulated by PMSG (Intergonan; Intervet) and hCG (Ovogest; Intervet) injection, inseminated artificially or by natural cover.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Microinjected oocytes were either cultured to blastocyst stage, or allowed to rest for 1 hr then transferred laparoscopically

Pregnancies were either terminated at day 15 to examine fetuses, or allowed to proceed to term. Offspring were delivered normally and their genotype was determined at approximately 3 weeks of age.
