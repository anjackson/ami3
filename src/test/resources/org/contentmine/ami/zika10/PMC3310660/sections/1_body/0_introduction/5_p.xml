<p class="p">A particularly promising approach is ZFN-mediated gene knockout directly in early embryos, because it offers a one-step method without any cell intermediate, as shown for zebrafish

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021045-Cui1" class="xref">[24]</xref>. However ZFNs are likely to make their greatest impact in species where classical means of gene targeting are not available. Here we demonstrate that ZFNs enable precise genetic engineering in a particularly intractable species.
