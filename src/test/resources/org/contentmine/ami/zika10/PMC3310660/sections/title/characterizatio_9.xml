 <p>A. The top panels show representative dot plot profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a wild type rabbit stained with antibodies specific for surface IgM (left) and surface IgG (right). Lower panels show Δ1/Δ7 PBMCs stained with the same antibodies. B. The upper dot plot shows wild type PBMCs immunostained with RACT30A, an antibody that recognizes a rabbit B-cell specific surface protein 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0021045-Davis1" href="#pone.0021045-Davis1">[25]</a>. The lower panel shows Δ1/Δ7 PBMCs stained the same way. A and B: Only live PBMCs were included in these analyses. C. Dot plot profiles showing wild type (left) and Δ7/Δ7 (right) PBMCs, stained intracellularly for the B cell receptor component CD79a. The percentage of gated B cells (IgM
