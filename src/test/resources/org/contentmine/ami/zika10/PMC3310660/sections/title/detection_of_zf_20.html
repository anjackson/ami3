         <sub>2</sub>, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% NP40, 0.5% Tween20 and 100 µg proteinase K; or by lysis
         in 8 µl 50 mM NaOH (10 min 95°C; 2 µl 1 M Tris, pH 7.5 then added for neutralization);
         and from fetal tissue or ear biopsies of offspring by standard methods. Rabbit Cµ

         specific for exon 1 or 2 consecutively. PCR products containing mutated sequences
         detected by DNA sequence chromatography were cloned into the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen)
         for DNA sequencing of ZFN-induced mutations.
