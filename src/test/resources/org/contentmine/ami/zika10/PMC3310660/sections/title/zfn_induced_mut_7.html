      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the ten rabbits identified as carrying ZFN induced mutant IgM alleles, eight (four
         males and four females) survived to sexual maturity and were used as founders to produce
         a F1 generation. Seven F0 rabbits transmitted mutant IgM alleles at frequencies ranging
         from 1.3% to 50% (
         <a>Table 1</a>). Among these, one male (22826) and one female (22821) both carried two independent
         mutations. The female failed to pass on either mutation to the next generation, but
         the male transmitted both mutations at a similar rate, suggesting that founder rabbits
         had different degrees of mosaicism.
