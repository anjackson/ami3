      <div>Targeted sequence replacement at the IgM locus.</div>
      <p>The structure of the IgME1 gene targeting vector, regions of homology with the IgM
         locus, and the predicted structure of the targeted locus are shown. Exons are marked
         and numbered as open boxes. The ZFN 18255/18257 cleavage site within exon 1 is indicated
         by a vertical arrow. The 5′ and 3′ junction PCR products are indicated; with positions
         of primers marked by arrows, and restriction sites for 
         <span>MscI</span> and 
         <span>ApaI</span> marked by (M) and (A), respectively. The hybridization probe and the diagnostic fragments
         used for Southern analysis are indicated in the lower part of the diagram. 
         <span>HinDIII</span> (H) and 
         <span>BspHI</span> (B) restriction sites are marked.
