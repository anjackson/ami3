      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ZFN design and validation</div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ZFNs directed against exons 1–4 of rabbit IgM (
         <a>Figure S1</a>) were designed using an archive of pre-validated zinc finger modules as described
         
         <a>[14]</a>, 
         <a>[15]</a>, 
         <a>[17]</a>–
         <a>[20]</a>. The ZFNs were ranked for activity using a budding yeast based system previously
         shown to identify nucleases active in editing endogenous loci in zebrafish and rat
         
         <a>[18]</a>, 
         <a>[20]</a>, and the highest-ranking ZFN for each exon was selected for 
         <span>in-vivo</span> use. Target sequence, structure and recognition helices of the selected ZFNs are
         shown in 
         <a>Figure 1 A–C</a>.

            <p>A. Recognition sequences in the rabbit IgM locus for ZFNs used in this study. B. Screening
               data using a budding yeast proxy system (see 
               <a>Materials and Methods</a>) for ZFNs shown in panel A. The first sample represents positive control ZFNs that
               target the human CCR5 locus 
               <a>[51]</a>. The grey and black bars represent reporter gene correction levels at low and high
               levels of ZFN synthesis, respectively. As detailed in Doyon et al. 
               <a>[18]</a>, the ZFN-encoding transgene is inducible, and this allows measurement of ZFN activity
               at different levels of the nuclease. C. DNA target sequences and recognition helices
               for the ZFNs used in the present work. The binding regions of left (ZFN-L) and right
               (ZFN-R) zinc finger protein array are underlined. Bases in capital letters are those
               that contribute to binding of the ZFP arrays. D. Summary of rabbit IgM mutant alleles
               obtained and characterized in offspring from ZFN microinjections. Stillborn animals
               are marked with an asterisk. The genotype of each allele is indicated to the right
               of the DNA sequence; inserted sequences are highlighted in red.
