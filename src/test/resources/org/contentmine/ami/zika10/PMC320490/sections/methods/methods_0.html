      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adult male Fischer-344 rats grouped as: i) Untreated rats: TPBIA was administered
         i.p. in various doses ii) Apomorphine-treated rats: were treated with apomorphine
         (1 mg kg
         <span>-1</span>, i.p.) 10 min after the administration of TPBIA. Afterwards the rats were placed
         individually in the activity cage and their motor behaviour was recorded for the next
         30 min The antioxidant potential of TPBIA was investigated in the model of in vitro
         non enzymatic lipid peroxidation.
