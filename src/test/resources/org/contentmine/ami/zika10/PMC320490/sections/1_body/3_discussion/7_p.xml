 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" class="xref">6</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25" class="xref">25</xref>] have shown that vitamin E (a well established antioxidant) may be effective in treating TD. However vitamin E does not cross readily the blood-brain barrier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26" class="xref">26</xref>], which could explain why other studies failed to confirm these results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" class="xref">6</xref>]. Therefore we considered interesting to investigate the antioxidant potential of the synthesized
