<p class="p">The description here is based on the first known collection from Washington, the two collections from British Columbia, and Old World material housed at CAN and UBC (see Specimens Examined), including collections made by H. &amp; J. Groves who first described the taxon over a century ago. The North American specimens of

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91" class="xref">Marchant 1968a</xref>). This character can be difficult to evaluate on herbarium specimens depending on how they were pressed, but should be more reliable in the field for distinguishing the taxa, particularly if they occur together. If stands of

  <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
