            <div>Spartina patens</div></span> exhibits considerable morphological variation and several authors have recognized
         two infraspecific taxa (see 
         <a>Mobberley 1956</a>). 
         <a>Mobberley (1956)</a> studied this variation across the native range of the taxon and found plants at the
         northern and southern extremes of the taxon’s range to be distinct, but considerable
         overlap and clinal variation from north to south in areas between the extremes. Based
         on these data he argued against the recognition of infraspecific taxa in 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina patens</div></span>, a circumscription followed by subsequent authors.

         the same length within an inflorescence [vs. branches not distinctly one-sided, appressed,

         apex], rhizomes wiry, plants forming dense mats [vs. rhizomes absent, rarely short,
         plants cespitose, forming distinct clumps], upper glumes distinctly 3-veined [vs.
         upper glumes 1-veined], and ligules 0.5–1 mm long [vs. ligules 1–2 mm long].
