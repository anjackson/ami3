      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The description presented here is based on the few specimens that have been collected
         in Washington and British Columbia and deposited in herbaria (see Specimens Examined).
         Variation in some characters, particularly vegetative characteristics such as leaf
         length and culm height, is probably greater than recorded here. For example, 
         <a>Mobberley (1956)</a> reported that culms in the species range to 1.5 m tall. For a description based on
         material from the native range of

            <div>Spartina densiflora</div></span> can be distinguished from 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span>, 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span>, and 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina Ã—townsendii</div></span> by the following combination of characters: plants cespitose [vs. strongly rhizomatous];
         blades involute for all or most of their length [vs. blades flat proximally, involute
         distally]; blade margins scabrous [vs. blade margins smooth]; branch rachises not
         prolonged beyond the terminal spikelet [vs. branch rachises prolonged beyond the terminal
         spikelet as a bristle, rarely not prolonged]; glume margins often purple-tinged [vs.
         glume margins whitish, not purple-tinged] (
         <a>Fig. 7</a>); and spikelets tightly appressed and strongly overlapping, concealing the rachis
         between spikelets [vs. spikelets weakly appressed and weakly to moderately overlapping,
         with portions of the rachis usually visible between spikelets]. In the field, the
         leaf margins of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina densiflora</div></span> may feel smooth to the touch, as the involute blades often conceal the leaf margins
         where the scabrous teeth are located; these scabrous teeth are best observed with
         a microscope (F. Lomer, personal communication, 2012).
