               <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span> is widespread across much of North America north of Mexico, distributed in southern
            Alberta, eastern Washington and Oregon, south to Texas, and east to Newfoundland and
            Labrador (
            <a>Barkworth 2003</a>). It grows in marshes, slough and floodplains, in dry prairies and along roads (
            <a>Barkworth 2003</a>). It is known from a few scattered sites in Britain and Ireland where it has been
            introduced and escaped from cultivation (
            <a>Cope and Gray 2009</a>).

            <a>Hitchcock et al. 1969</a>,

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">British Columbia is the only Canadian province in which 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span> is not native, but the taxon has been variously recognized as part of its flora.
            In the first major treatment of the British Columbia flora, Joseph K. 
            <a>Henry (1915)</a> reported the non-native 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina cynosuroides</div></span>, an Atlantic coast taxon confused at the time with 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span> according to 
            <a>Eastham (1947)</a>, which Henry suggested might be present in the southern interior based on its presence
            in adjacent Washington. No collections of 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span> from the southern interior of British Columbia have been made. 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span> was added to the flora of British Columbia by 
            <a>Eastham (1947)</a>, based on a single collection made by V. Brink on the shore of Sea Island at the
            mouth of the Fraser River (where the Vancouver International Airport is now located).
            Eastham suggested that it might have been transported to this location down the river
            from the interior, but this is unlikely since there are no reports of the taxon from
            interior British Columbia. Based on this single record, 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span> was recognized as part of the British Columbia flora in subsequent floristic works
            (
            <a>Hubbard 1969</a>, 
            <a>Taylor and MacBryde 1977</a>, 
            <a>Scoggan 1978</a>), but was later excluded by 
            <a>Douglas et al. (1994)</a> on the basis of being
             an introduced species not collected in over 40 years. This exclusion was followed
            in recent treatments (
            <a>Qian and Klinka 1998</a>, 
            <a>Douglas et al. 2001</a>). Attempts to locate the Brink collection in British Columbia herbaria (V, UBC) were
            unsuccessful, and it is therefore not possible to confirm this report.. 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span> was recently collected in a vacant lot in the city of Burnaby (Lomer 6778, 
            <a>Fig. 10</a>, 6805, Suppl. Fig. 33), where it likely escaped or persisted from cultivation (F.
            Lomer, personal communication, 2011). The clump from which these specimens were obtained
            no longer exists, as the site has been built over (F. Lomer, personal communication,
            2012). The specimens reported here are the first confirmed records of 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span> for British Columbia. The species is not considered to be invasive.
