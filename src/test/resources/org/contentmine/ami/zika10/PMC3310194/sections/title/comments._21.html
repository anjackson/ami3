            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> is an amphidiploid taxon that arose in Britain in the 18
         <span>th</span> century from chromosome doubling of the sterile F1 hybrid taxon 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina Ã—townsendii</div></span> (see the discussion under that species for details, and reviews in Marchant 1968
         and 
         <a>Gray et al. 1991</a>). The origin of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> is a remarkable and well-studied example of allopolyploid evolution.

            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> is a problematic invasive species in coastal areas of western North America, and
         has been present on the continent for over fifty years. In the United States it is
         known from Washington and California. It was planted in Puget Sound, Washington in
         1961 (
         <a>Spicher and Josselyn 1985</a>, 
         <a>Frenkel 1987</a>) to provide forage for cattle and to stabilize a dike system (
         <a>Hacker et al. 2001</a>). By 1997, it had expanded substantially in Puget Sound, occurring in 73 sites and
         covering 397 solid hectares of intertidal habitat (
         <a>Hacker et al. 2001</a>, see 
         <a>Hedge et al. 2003</a>). Eradication efforts in this region began in 1997 (
         <a>Hacker et al. 2001</a>). In 1977 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> was deliberately transplanted from Puget Sound to California where it was introduced
         at Creekside Park Marsh in San Francisco Bay, Marin County (
         <a>Spicher and Josselyn 1985</a>), and it persists at this single location in the state (e.g., 
         <a>Grijalva et al. 2006</a>, 
         <a>San Francisco Estuary Invasive Spartina Project 2012</a>). 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> is mentioned, but not treated in 
         <a>Baird and Thieret (2012)</a>.

            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> was discovered in British Columbia in 2003 on Roberts Banks in the Fraser River estuary
         and in Boundary Bay along the British Columbia and Washington border (
         <a>Williams 2004</a>). 
         <a>Williams (2004)</a> noted the infestation to be in its early stages in 2003, and estimated the species
         to have arrived in the area some three to five years earlier. Additional collections
         were made in 2004 in Boundary Bay (Lim s.n., V-two specimens) and on Roberts Banks
         (
         <a>Williams 2004</a>-1, 2004-2 [
         <a>Fig. 3</a>], 2004-3). Following this initial documentation of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> in British Columbia, extensive field surveys and mapping exercises were undertaken
         to determine the extent of the species at Roberts Bank and in Boundary Bay, and an
         eradication plan was implemented (Dresen et al. 2010; 
         <a>Williams et al. 2010</a>). Despite removal and eradication efforts, by 2009 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> had increased dramatically in these regions (
         <a>Ducks Unlimited Canada 2010</a>). It is currently reproducing by seed production and vegetatively by outward clonal
         growth forming meadows and by drifting plant parts (R. Knight, personal communication
         2010). There are only a few herbarium collections documenting 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> in the province, collected by G. Williams and P. Lim when the taxon was first found.
         Additional collections should be made at these and other sites where the species is
         found, to properly document its continued existence and spread.
