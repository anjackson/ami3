  </span> was the first of the invasive cordgrasses to be collected in British Columbia. It was discovered in 1979 in the Comox Estuary on Vancouver Island (Brayshaw 79-1143, V); nearly a decade later, in 1988, it was collected on the adjacent mainland coast in Burrard Inlet, North Vancouver (Lomer 88–140, UBC,

  </span> was recognized as part of the provincial flora by

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B45" href="#B45">Douglas et al. 2001</a>). Large stands of the species were reported in 2000 at the Comox locality in the Courtenay River estuary at the delta of Brooklyn Creek to the embayed area of Goose Spit (
