  </span> is present in California, Washington, and British Columbia. It was first established in California. It occurs in Humboldt Bay, where it is thought to have been introduced by shipping in the late 1800s (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B132" href="#B132">Spicher and Josselyn 1985</a>, Kittleson and Boyd 1997). Prior to the early 1980s, this population was erroneously thought to be a native form of

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B49" href="#B49">Faber 2000</a>), and independently to Richardson Bay. Hybrids between

  </span> is now invading British Columbia, where it was first found in 2005 in Bayne’s Sound, a channel between Vancouver Island and Denman Island (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B101" href="#B101">Morgan and Sytsma 2010</a>). It is not reported for the province in several recent floras that consider the region (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B17" href="#B17">Barkworth 2003</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B85" href="#B85">Kozloff 2005</a>), but is included in the online E-Flora BC (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">Anonymous 2011</a>). In the Bayne’s Sound region, only a few herbarium collections documenting the species have been made; these are from Fanny Bay (Lomer 5723, CAN, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6</a>) and the Buckley Bay Ferry Terminal (Lomer 7377, CAN). Some data on the extent of the invasion are given by 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B101" href="#B101">Morgan and Sytsma (2010)</a> and Dresen et al. (2010), who mapped the species in Bayne’s Sound where the extent of its local distribution ranges from individual plants to multiple five meter patches. Detailed characterization of this invasion has not otherwise appeared in the literature.
