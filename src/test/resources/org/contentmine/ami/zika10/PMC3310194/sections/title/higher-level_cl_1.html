            <div>Spartina</div></span> is a member of the grass subfamily Chloridoideae Kunth ex Beilschm., one of six major
         lineages (subfamilies) in the grass PACMAD clade, which also includes the subfamilies
         Panicoideae Link, Arundinoideae Burmeist., Micrairoideae Pilg., Aristidoideae Caro
         and Danthonioideae H.P.Linder &amp; N.P.Barker (reviewed in 
         <a>Saarela and Graham 2010</a>). Chloridoideae includes some 1420 species in approximately 140 genera (
         <a>Peterson et al. 2010</a>). In the most recent classification of Chloridoideae, 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina</div></span> is included in the tribe 
         <span>
            <div>Zoyseae</div></span> Benth., a lineage characterized by glabrous culm nodes, ligules that are a line of
         hairs or a fringed membrane, bisexual spikelets that are laterally compressed (or
         terete, rarely dorsiventrally compressed), spikelets with a single floret, lower glumes
         nerveless or 1-veined, lemmas 1- or 3-veined and awnless, ovaries glabrous, a base
         chromosome number of x = 7–10, and a preference for saline habitats (
         <a>Peterson et al. 2007</a>, 
         <a>2010</a>). 
         <span>
            <div>Zoyseae</div></span> includes the 
         <span>incertae sedis</span> genus 
         <span>
            <div>Urochondra</div></span> C.E. Hubb. and the subtribes 
         <span>
            <div>Zoysiinae</div></span> Benth. (one genus, 
         <span>
            <div>Zoysia</div></span> Willd.) and 
         <span>
            <div>Sporobolinae</div></span> Benth. 
         <span>
            <div>Sporobolinae</div></span> is characterized by spikelets oriented abaxially along the axis with the lemma facing
         
         the rachis, lemmas that are similar in texture to the glumes, paleas that are relatively
         long and approximately equal in length to the lemma, and free (reluctantly free in
         
         <span>
            <div>Spartina</div></span>) pericarps (
         <a>Peterson et al. 2007</a>). 
         <span>
            <div>Sporobolinae</div></span> includes the large polyphyletic genus 
         <span>
            <div>Sporobolus</div></span> R.Br.(some 200 species; 
         <a>Simon et al. 2011</a>) in which the genera 
         <span>
            <div>Calamovilfa</div></span> (A. Gray) Hack. ex Scribn. &amp; Southw., 
         <span>
            <div>Crypsis</div></span> Aiton, 
         <span>
            <div>Pogoneura</div></span> Napper, and 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina</div></span> are embedded – a phylogenetic structure that has been identified in multiple molecular
         studies (e.g., 
         <a>Hilu and Alice 2001</a>, 
         <a>Columbus et al. 2007</a>, 
         <a>Peterson et al. 2010</a>). 
         <a>Peterson et al. (2010)</a> recommended future expansion of 
         <span>
            <div>Sporobolus</div></span> to include all of these genera, including the monophyletic 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina</div></span>, reflecting their origins from within the 
         <span>
            <div>Sporobolus</div></span> line. If (or more likely, when) these nomenclatural changes are proposed, species
         currently treated in 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina</div></span> would be treated as species of 
         <span>
            <div>Sporobolus</div></span>, more accurately reflecting our understanding of the evolutionary history of these
         grasses and their closest relatives.
