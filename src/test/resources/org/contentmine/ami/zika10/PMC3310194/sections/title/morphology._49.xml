  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B99" href="#B99">Mobberley 1956</a>). 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B99" href="#B99">Mobberley (1956)</a> studied this variation across the native range of the taxon and found plants at the northern and southern extremes of the taxon’s range to be distinct, but considerable overlap and clinal variation from north to south in areas between the extremes. Based on these data he argued against the recognition of infraspecific taxa in 
  <span class="italic">

  </span>, a circumscription followed by subsequent authors.
