            <div>Spartina patens</div></span> grows in coastal salt marshes and brackish waters, where it usually forms dense stands
         above the intertidal zone and into higher and drier areas of the salt marsh (
         <a>Mobberley 1956</a>). In Europe this taxon is sometimes treated as a separate species, 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina versicolor</div></span> Fabre, a traditional circumscription that some contemporary authors maintain (e.g.,
         
         <a>Sánchez Gullón 2001</a>; 
         <a>Clayton et al. 2002</a> onwards; see 
         <a>SanLeón et al. 1999</a> and 
         <a>Prieto et al. 2011</a> for summaries of this taxonomic problem). In North America

         <span>
            <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span> in areas where they grow together, forming the hybrid taxon 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×cespitosa</div></span>. This hybrid is known from scattered locations along the Atlantic coast from Prince
         Edward Island to Maryland (

         <a>Dore and Marchant 1968</a>, 
         <a>Barkworth 2003</a>), but has not been recorded along the Pacific coast. The biology of

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Oregon, 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina patens</div></span> grows in the Siuslaw estuary on Cox Island (Lane Co.), where it has been introduced
         since at least 1939 and has expanded considerably since that time (
         <a>Frenkel and Boss 1988</a>). It is not reported from elsewhere in Oregon (
         <a>Wilson et al. 2012</a>). In Washington it has been reported from Dosewallips State Park on the west shore
         of Hood Canal (
         <a>Frenkel 1987</a>). In California it is present in Southampton Marsh in San Francisco Bay (
         <a>Spicher and Josselyn 1985</a>, 
         <a>Baird and Thieret 2012</a>).

            <div>Spartina patens</div></span> was the first of the invasive cordgrasses to be collected in British Columbia. It
         was discovered in 1979 in the Comox Estuary on Vancouver Island (Brayshaw 79-1143,
         V); nearly a decade later, in 1988, it was collected on the adjacent mainland coast
         in Burrard Inlet, North Vancouver (Lomer 88–140, UBC, 
         <a>Fig. 9</a>). 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina patens</div></span> was recognized as part of the provincial flora by 
         <a>Douglas et al. (1994)</a> based on collections from these two localities, and is reported for the region in
         recent floras (
         <a>Barkworth 2003</a>, 
         <a>Douglas et al. 2001</a>). Large stands of the species were reported in 2000 at the Comox locality in the
         Courtenay River estuary at the delta of Brooklyn Creek to the embayed area of Goose
         Spit (
         <a>Asp and Adams 2000</a>). 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina patens</div></span> is also reported from Port Moody Arm of Burrard Inlet in British Columbia (Dresen
         et al. 2010). Voucher specimens from these latter two sites should be collected and
         deposited in herbaria.
