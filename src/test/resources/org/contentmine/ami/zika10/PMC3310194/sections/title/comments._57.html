            <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span> is not considered to be a problematic invasive species, though it has been introduced
         sporadically to other regions, such as the United Kingdom. It occurs natively in eastern
         Washington and Oregon (
         <a>Hitchcock et al. 1969</a>, 
         <a>Barkworth 2003</a>). 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span> is grown as an ornamental.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">British Columbia is the only Canadian province in which 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span> is not native, but the taxon has been variously recognized as part of its flora.
         In the first major treatment of the British Columbia flora, Joseph K. 
         <a>Henry (1915)</a> reported the non-native 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina cynosuroides</div></span>, an Atlantic coast taxon confused at the time with 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span> according to 
         <a>Eastham (1947)</a>, which Henry suggested might be present in the southern interior based on its presence
         in adjacent Washington. No collections of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span> from the southern interior of British Columbia have been made. 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span> was added to the flora of British Columbia by 
         <a>Eastham (1947)</a>, based on a single collection made by V. Brink on the shore of Sea Island at the
         mouth of the Fraser River (where the Vancouver International Airport is now located).
         Eastham suggested that it might have been transported to this location down the river
         from the interior, but this is unlikely since there are no reports of the taxon from
         interior British Columbia. Based on this single record, 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span> was recognized as part of the British Columbia flora in subsequent floristic works
         (
         <a>Hubbard 1969</a>, 
         <a>Taylor and MacBryde 1977</a>, 
         <a>Scoggan 1978</a>), but was later excluded by 
         <a>Douglas et al. (1994)</a> on the basis of being
          an introduced species not collected in over 40 years. This exclusion was followed
         in recent treatments (
         <a>Qian and Klinka 1998</a>, 
         <a>Douglas et al. 2001</a>). Attempts to locate the Brink collection in British Columbia herbaria (V, UBC) were
         unsuccessful, and it is therefore not possible to confirm this report.. 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span> was recently collected in a vacant lot in the city of Burnaby (Lomer 6778, 
         <a>Fig. 10</a>, 6805, Suppl. Fig. 33), where it likely escaped or persisted from cultivation (F.
         Lomer, personal communication, 2011). The clump from which these specimens were obtained
         no longer exists, as the site has been built over (F. Lomer, personal communication,
         2012). The specimens reported here are the first confirmed records of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span> for British Columbia. The species is not considered to be invasive.
