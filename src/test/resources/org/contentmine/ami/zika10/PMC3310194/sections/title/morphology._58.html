            <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span> is readily distinguished from all other taxa in the Pacific Northwest by its conspicuously
         awned glumes [vs. glumes unawned or short-awned (awns to 2 mm long), the latter state
         sometimes present in 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina gracilis</div></span>], and glume keels with robust, comb-like teeth [vs. glume keels that are glabrous,
         scabrous or ciliate]. Additional characters are given under other taxa.
