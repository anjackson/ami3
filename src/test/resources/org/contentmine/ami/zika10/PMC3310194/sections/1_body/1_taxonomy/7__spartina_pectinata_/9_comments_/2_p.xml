<p class="p">British Columbia is the only Canadian province in which 
 <italic class="italic">
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina pectinata</named-content>
 </italic> is not native, but the taxon has been variously recognized as part of its flora. In the first major treatment of the British Columbia flora, Joseph K. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69" class="xref">Henry (1915)</xref> reported the non-native 
 <italic class="italic">
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina cynosuroides</named-content>
 </italic>, an Atlantic coast taxon confused at the time with 
 <italic class="italic">
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina pectinata</named-content>
 </italic> according to 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47" class="xref">Eastham (1947)</xref>, which Henry suggested might be present in the southern interior based on its presence in adjacent Washington. No collections of 
 <italic class="italic">
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina pectinata</named-content>
 </italic> from the southern interior of British Columbia have been made. 
 <italic class="italic">
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina pectinata</named-content>
 </italic> was added to the flora of British Columbia by 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47" class="xref">Eastham (1947)</xref>, based on a single collection made by V. Brink on the shore of Sea Island at the mouth of the Fraser River (where the Vancouver International Airport is now located). Eastham suggested that it might have been transported to this location down the river from the interior, but this is unlikely since there are no reports of the taxon from interior British Columbia. Based on this single record, 
 <italic class="italic">
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina pectinata</named-content>
 </italic> was recognized as part of the British Columbia flora in subsequent floristic works (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80" class="xref">Hubbard 1969</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B137" class="xref">Taylor and MacBryde 1977</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B129" class="xref">Scoggan 1978</xref>), but was later excluded by 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44" class="xref">Douglas et al. (1994)</xref> on the basis of being
 <!--PageBreak--> an introduced species not collected in over 40 years. This exclusion was followed in recent treatments (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B113" class="xref">Qian and Klinka 1998</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45" class="xref">Douglas et al. 2001</xref>). Attempts to locate the Brink collection in British Columbia herbaria (V, UBC) were unsuccessful, and it is therefore not possible to confirm this report.. 
 <italic class="italic">
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina pectinata</named-content>
 </italic> was recently collected in a vacant lot in the city of Burnaby (Lomer 6778, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10" class="xref">Fig. 10</xref>, 6805, Suppl. Fig. 33), where it likely escaped or persisted from cultivation (F. Lomer, personal communication, 2011). The clump from which these specimens were obtained no longer exists, as the site has been built over (F. Lomer, personal communication, 2012). The specimens reported here are the first confirmed records of 
 <italic class="italic">
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina pectinata</named-content>
 </italic> for British Columbia. The species is not considered to be invasive.
