  <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>

Since the taxon is sterile and does not set seed, it must have been introduced into Boundary Bay by vegetative reproduction, probably from rhizome fragments transported in tidal currents. It is possible that the British Columbia plants originated from the stand at Stanwood, Washington, if it persists, or there may be other extant occurrences of
