         <span>
            <div>Spartina</div></span> have been produced by 
         <a>Merrill (1902)</a>, 
         <a>Saint-Yves (1932)</a> and 
         <a>Mobberley (1956)</a>, the latter being the most recent and comprehensive, though it does not cite the
         specimens examined during the study. 
         <a>Mobberley (1956)</a> recognized some fifteen taxa in the genus, including three native to the Old World
         (
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span>, 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina maritima</div></span> (Curtis) Fernald, 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span>), and the remainder native to the New World. There are thirteen species of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina</div></span> in North America, of which nine are native (including one natural hybrid), and four
         are introduced (
         <a>Mobberley 1956</a>, 
         <a>Barkworth 2003</a>). They are distributed in low to high intertidal marsh (brackish), inland brackish
         and freshwater habitats and dry prairie, and have been classified ecologically by
         habitat as low marsh, high marsh, and freshwater (
         <a>Maricle et al. 2009</a>). Marsh taxa include the native species 
         <span>

         <span>
            <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span>, and the hybrid taxon 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×caespitosa</div></span> A.A. Eaton (mixed cordgrass;

            <div>Spartina</div></span> has a base chromosome number of 
         <span>x</span> = 10, and all species are polyploids (e.g., 
         <a>Marchant 1963</a>, 
         <a>1986b</a>, 
         <a>Ayres et al. 2008</a>, 
         <a>Fortune et al. 2008</a>, 
         <a>Renny-Byfield et al. 2010</a>). Phylogenetic analyses based on two nuclear (ITS and 
         <span>Waxy</span>) and one plastid locus identified two major lineages in the genus, one comprising
         the tetraploid (2
         <span>n</span> = 40) species 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina patens</div></span>,

            <div>Spartina ciliata</div></span> Brongn.,

            <div>Spartina bakeri</div></span>, and 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina arundinacea</div></span> (Thouars) Carmich., and the other comprising the hexaploid (2
         <span>n</span> = 60, 62) species 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span>, 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina foliosa</div></span>, and

            <div>Spartina maritim</div></span>a (Curtis) Fernald (
         <a>Baumel et al. 2002b</a>). In this analysis one tetraploid species, 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina argentinensis</div></span> Parodi, was sister to the hexaploid clade, and placement of the heptaploid 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina densiflora</div></span> (2
         <span>n</span> = 70, 
         <a>Ayres et al. 2008</a>, 
         <a>Fortune et al. 2008</a>) differed among data partitions (
         <a>Baumel et al. 2002b</a>). A subsequent phylogenetic study, based on extensive cloning of the low copy nuclear
         gene 
         <span>Waxy</span>, focused on the hexaploid taxa and revealed a more complicated phylogeny, and an
         allopolyploid
          origin for the hexaploid clade was proposed (
         <a>Fortune et al. 2007</a>). Further phylogenetic study of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina densiflora</div></span> revealed the taxon to be of hybrid origin involving lineages related to the tetraploid
         species 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina arundinacea</div></span> and the hexaploid clade (
         <a>Fortune et al. 2008</a>).
