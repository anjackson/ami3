      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Determining pollen fertility by staining anthers with lactophenol cotton blue is a
         useful way to distinguish male sterile hybrid plants from those that are fertile,
         as the cytoplasm of fertile pollen grains readily takes up the stain whereas sterile
         (i.e., aborted) pollen grains do not. Pollen staining is thus an effective, though
         more technically involved method, to definitively distinguish the fertile 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> from the sterile F1 hybrid 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span>, as demonstrated by 
         <a>Marchant (1968a)</a>. To confirm identifications of these taxa here, and to demonstrate the utility of
         this technique, I determined pollen fertility for multiple herbarium specimens of
         
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> and 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> using lactophenol cotton blue; collections examined in this manner are identified
         with the symbol † in the specimen list below and under 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span>. One to three anthers were sampled from a spikelet on each specimen, and these were
         macerated with forceps in a drop of water on a glass slide to release the pollen.
         One or a few drops of lactophenol cotton blue were added to the slide and after sitting
         for a minimum of ten minutes, the slides were examined at 20× to 60× magnification
         with a compound microscope. In general, the number of pollen grains recovered per
         specimen
          varied with the stage of pollen development. For example, in specimens of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> that had been collected during or after dehiscence, fewer pollen grains were available
         for study, whereas in 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> dehiscence does not occur and abundant pollen grains were recovered from the anthers.
         In fertile pollen grains the cytoplasm was evidently visible and stained, whereas
         in sterile pollen there was no or little evidence of cytoplasmic staining (
         <a>Fig. 5</a>). All plants that were determined morphologically to be 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> had fertile pollen, and all plants determined as 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> had sterile pollen.
