 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The description presented here is based on the few specimens that have been collected in Washington and British Columbia and deposited in herbaria (see Specimens Examined). Variation in some characters, particularly vegetative characteristics such as leaf length and culm height, is probably greater than recorded here. For example, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B99" href="#B99">Mobberley (1956)</a> reported that culms in the species range to 1.5 m tall. For a description based on material from the native range of

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F7" href="#F7">Fig. 7</a>); and spikelets tightly appressed and strongly overlapping, concealing the rachis between spikelets [vs. spikelets weakly appressed and weakly to moderately overlapping, with portions of the rachis usually visible between spikelets]. In the field, the leaf margins of

   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina densiflora</div>
