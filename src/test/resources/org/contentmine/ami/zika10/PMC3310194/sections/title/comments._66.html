      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the mid to late 1800s an unknown cordgrass of restricted distribution appeared
         and spread rapidly along the shores of Southampton Water, England (
         <a>Stapf 1914</a>), which differed morphologically (particularly by its sterile pollen) from 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina maritima</div></span>, the single cordgrass species native to the Atlantic coast of Europe and north Africa
         (
         <a>Marchant and Goodman 1969c</a>), and the introduced 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span>, which had been present in the region since the early part of the 19
         <span>th</span> century. The brothers Henry and James Grove (1881) described this taxon as 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span> from plants collected near Hythe. In the 1890s a second form of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span>, which was recognized and considered distinct by having fertile stamens, was collected
         at multiple localities in the region, and by the mid twentieth century it had expanded
         substantially on tidal flats across the British Isles (see 
         <a>Goodman et al. 1959</a>, 
         <a>Hubbard 1957</a>, 
         <a>1965</a>). For decades these two forms (one sterile, the other fertile) of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span> were referred to collectively as the 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span> aggregate or 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span> sensu lato. Because of its vigorous growth and ability to rapidly colonize and stabilize
         mud flats, 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span> s.l. was considered to be a “useful” species and was distributed and planted widely
         for land reclamation, coastal protection, and animal feed across the British Isles,
         Europe, and in New Zealand (e.g., 
         <a>Oliver 1925</a>, 
         <a>Harboard 1949</a>, 
         <a>Goodman et al. 1959</a>, 
         <a>Ranwell 1967</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soon after its formal description 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span> was considered to be a species of hybrid origin. 
         <a>Foucaud (1894)</a> suggested that 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span> was probably a hybrid of the native 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina maritima</div></span> and the introduced 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span>, a hypothesis later supported by 
         <a>Stapf (1914)</a> and Huskins (1930), who examined cytological evidence and hypothesized that fertile
         plants of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span> s.l. originated from chromosome doubling following hybridization between its parent
         species. 
         <a>Marchant (1963)</a> confirmed this work, and reported chromosome numbers as 2
         <span>n</span> = 62 for 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span>, 2
         <span>n</span> = 60 for 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina maritima</div></span>, 2
         <span>n</span> = 62 for sterile plants of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span>, and 2
         <span>n</span> = 120, 122, 124 for fertile plants of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span>. The hybrid and chromosome doubling origins of the forms of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span> have been confirmed by multiple lines of molecular evidence (
         <a>Guénégou et al. 1988</a>, 
         <a>Raybould et al. 1991</a>, 
         <a>Ferris et al. 1997</a>, 
         <a>Ayres and Strong 2001</a>, 
         <a>Baumel et al. 2003</a>). 
         <a>Hubbard (1957)</a> observed the type specimen of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span> to be the sterile F1 hybrid, and the taxon was subsequently referred to as 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span>. The fertile plants remained without a name until 
         <a>Hubbard (1978)</a> later described them as 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span>, and the two forms have since been recognized as distinct taxa. Molecular data have
         identified 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> as the female parent and 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina maritima</div></span> as the male parent in the origin of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> (e.g., 
         <a>Ferris et al. 1997</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An independent origin of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> is documented in France. In 1894 Jules Foucaud described 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina neyrautii</div></span> Fouc. from southwestern France and northern Spain. 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina neyrautii</div></span> was initially considered to be a variant of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina maritima</div></span> (e.g., Chevalier 1923, 
         <a>Saint-Yves 1932</a>), but was later recognized as a morphologically and cytologically distinct hybrid,
         
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×neyrautii</div></span>,with the same parentage as 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> (e.g., 
         <a>Jovet 1941</a>, 
         <a>Chevalier 1933</a>, 
         <a>Marchant 1977</a>). 
         <a>Baumel et al. (2003)</a> confirmed this with molecular data, demonstrating that 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×neyrautii</div></span> and 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> originated independently by hybridization between the same maternal (
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span>) and paternal (
         <span>
            <div>Spartina maritima</div></span>) taxa. Because both taxa apply to the hybrid 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora × S. maritima</div></span>, the later name 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×neyrautii</div></span> is a synonym of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span>, in accordance with article H.2 of the Vienna Code (
         <a>McNeill et al. 2006</a>), and as noted earlier by 
         <a>Raybould et al. (1990)</a>. In recent decades it has been documented that these hybrid plants are highly restricted
         in distribution in 
         France (
         <a>Marchant 1977</a>, 
         <a>Hubbard et al. 1978</a>, 
         <a>Raybould et al. 1990</a>, 
         <a>Baumel et al. 2003</a>). Minor morphological differences between 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×neyrautii</div></span> and 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> were noted by 
         <a>Marchant (1977)</a>. Measurements of spikelet characters in 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×neyrautii</div></span> type material examined at US fall within the range of variation reported here for

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> has been introduced into North America, where apparently only a single occurrence
         has been reported in the literature. 
         <a>Hitchcock et al. (1969)</a> noted a single known population of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> in Washington at Stanwood, Snohomish Co. At the time of that publication, the fertile
         (=
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span>) and non-fertile forms of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> were not distinguished taxonomically, and it is not explicitly clear from the flora
         which form of the taxon was known from the site. A specimen collected in 1965 from
         this population [Austenson s.n. (WTU, Suppl. Fig. 35)] is here confirmed to be the
         F1 sterile hybrid 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span>. The determination of a more recent collection from the Stanwood area identified
         as 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> requires confirmation (Snohomish Co., Davis Slough west of Stanwood, 25 Aug 1990,
         M.Arnot 254, WTU-317391, not seen). A 2005 collection from Washington originally identified
         as 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> (Giblin &amp; Legler 270 WTU) is here re-determined to be 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span>. 
         <a>Barkworth (2003)</a> included 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> in her treatment of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina</div></span> for North America, but did not include a distribution map or otherwise indicate a
         range for the species, suggesting some confusion in the literature on its status in
         North America. 
         <a>Kozloff (2005)</a> also included 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> (as well as 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span>) in his Pacific Northwest flora, indicating only ‘coastal salt marshes’ for its distribution.
         There apparently are no published data on the current status of the Stanwood population.
         If the population at Stanwood persists, new collections should be made to document
         its continued existence at the site, and if other populations are known or discovered,
         herbarium collections should be made to document their existences.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> has not previously been reported from British Columbia. It is here reported as new
         for the province on the basis of two collections made in 2006 in in Boundary Bay at
         sites separated by some 4.4 kilometers (by air)[Taylor 80 (UBC, 
         <a>Fig. 11</a>) and Saarela &amp; Percy 791 (CAN, 
         <a>Fig. 12</a>, UBC, Suppl. Fig. 34)]. These appear to be the most recent confirmed reports of the
         taxon in North America since it was collected at Stanwood, Washington. Herbarium specimens
         of these collections were initially determined (incorrectly) as 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> and 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span>, since 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> was not expected in British Columbia. Subsequent study of this material, in combination
         with the 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina</div></span> taxonomic literature and comparisons with specimens of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> and Old World specimens of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> at CAN and UBC, confirmed the specimens to be 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span>, prompting the current taxonomic study. Pollen in these specimens is sterile, as
         determined by pollen staining (see discussion under 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span>, 
         <a>Fig. 5</a>), further confirming their identities as 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span>. Specimens from which pollen was extracted and stained with lactophenol cotton blue
         to assess fertility are identified with the symbol † in the Specimens Examined below.

         Bay sub-populations in 2006 aside from notes on the Saarela and Percy collection label

         have been removed. The region should be studied to determine if the taxon is present.
         Since the taxon is sterile and does not set seed, it must have been introduced into
         Boundary Bay by vegetative reproduction, probably from rhizome fragments transported
         in tidal currents. It is possible that the British Columbia plants originated from
         the stand at Stanwood, Washington, if it persists, or there may be other extant occurrences
         of
