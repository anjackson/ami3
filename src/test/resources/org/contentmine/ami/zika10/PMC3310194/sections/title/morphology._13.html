            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> and the European species 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina maritima</div></span> are the parents of the sterile F1 hybrid 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span>; unsurprisingly, 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> is morphologically similar to 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> and the amphidiploid 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span>. It can be distinguished from these taxa by its shorter spikelets [8–14(–16.5) mm
         vs. 14–25 mm], narrower branch rachises [0.4–1 mm wide between spikelets vs. 1–2.2
         mm wide], glumes glabrous or weakly pubescent [vs. glumes weakly to densely pubescent],
         and leaf blades erect, forming an angle of 15–18° with the culm [vs. leaf blades spreading,
         forming an angle of 30–60° with the culm]. Spikelets of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> are shown in 
         <a>Fig. 1</a>, and an exemplar specimen is shown in 
         <a>Fig. 2</a>. Glumes in 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> vary from glabrous to pubescent (details on this variation are given in 
         <a>Mobberley 1956</a>). In
          individuals with glabrous glumes, this is a good character for distinguishing 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> from 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> and 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span>, which consistently have pubescent glumes, but the character is more difficult to
         interpret and less reliable in 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> individuals with pubescent glumes. 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> also tends to have narrower inflorescences than 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> and 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> [(5–)6–10(–15) mm wide vs. 7–25 mm wide], but there is considerable overlap in this
         character. Recent taxonomic keys (
         <a>Barkworth 2003</a>, 
         <a>Kozloff 2005</a>) distinguishing these three taxa emphasize variation in number of panicle branches
         (3–25 in 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> vs. 1–12 in the other taxa). I found this character unreliable in material examined
         here, and do not include it in the key. 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> can further be distinguished from 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> by its shorter anthers [3–6 mm long vs. 7–10 mm long], and from 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> by its fully exserted, dehiscent anthers at anthesis and fertile pollen [vs. anthers
         not or incompletely exserted, indehiscent and sterile pollen]. 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> is readily distinguished from 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina densiflora</div></span>, 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina gracilis</div></span>, 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina patens</div></span> and 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span> by it glabrous leaf blade margins [vs. scabrous leaf blade margins].

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is considerable morphological variation in 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> throughout its native range with northern plants from Canada and Maine tending to
         have looser inflorescences, weakly overlapping spikelets, and less glume pubescence,
         and southern plants tighter inflorescences, more strongly overlapping spikelets, and
         more pubescent glumes. This variation has been recognized taxonomically in the past
         at the species and infraspecific levels; however, 
         <a>Mobberley (1956)</a> demonstrated the variation to be clinal and therefore taxonomically inconsistent,
         and only a single taxon is now generally accepted (e.g., 
         <a>Barkworth 2003</a>). Specimens examined from the Pacific coast in Washington have moderately overlapping
         spikelets.
