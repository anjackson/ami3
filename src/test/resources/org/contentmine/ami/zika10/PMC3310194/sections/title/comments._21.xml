  </span> is an amphidiploid taxon that arose in Britain in the 18
  <span class="sup">th</span> century from chromosome doubling of the sterile F1 hybrid taxon 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina Ã—townsendii</div>
  </span> (see the discussion under that species for details, and reviews in Marchant 1968 and

  </span> is a problematic invasive species in coastal areas of western North America, and has been present on the continent for over fifty years. In the United States it is known from Washington and California. It was planted in Puget Sound, Washington in 1961 (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B56" href="#B56">Frenkel 1987</a>) to provide forage for cattle and to stabilize a dike system (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B66" href="#B66">Hacker et al. 2001</a>). By 1997, it had expanded substantially in Puget Sound, occurring in 73 sites and covering 397 solid hectares of intertidal habitat (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B66" href="#B66">Hacker et al. 2001</a>, see 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B68" href="#B68">Hedge et al. 2003</a>). Eradication efforts in this region began in 1997 (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B66" href="#B66">Hacker et al. 2001</a>). In 1977 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina anglica</div>
  </span> was deliberately transplanted from Puget Sound to California where it was introduced at Creekside Park Marsh in San Francisco Bay, Marin County (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B132" href="#B132">Spicher and Josselyn 1985</a>), and it persists at this single location in the state (e.g.,

   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina anglica</div>
  </span> was discovered in British Columbia in 2003 on Roberts Banks in the Fraser River estuary and in Boundary Bay along the British Columbia and Washington border (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B140" href="#B140">Williams 2004</a>). 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B140" href="#B140">Williams (2004)</a> noted the infestation to be in its early stages in 2003, and estimated the species to have arrived in the area some three to five years earlier. Additional collections were made in 2004 in Boundary Bay (Lim s.n., V-two specimens) and on Roberts Banks (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B140" href="#B140">Williams 2004</a>-1, 2004-2 [

  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina anglica</div>
  </span> in British Columbia, extensive field surveys and mapping exercises were undertaken to determine the extent of the species at Roberts Bank and in Boundary Bay, and an eradication plan was implemented (Dresen et al. 2010; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B141" href="#B141">Williams et al. 2010</a>). Despite removal and eradication efforts, by 2009 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina anglica</div>
  </span> had increased dramatically in these regions (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B46" href="#B46">Ducks Unlimited Canada 2010</a>). It is currently reproducing by seed production and vegetatively by outward clonal growth forming meadows and by drifting plant parts (R. Knight, personal communication 2010). There are only a few herbarium collections documenting 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina anglica</div>
  </span> in the province, collected by G. Williams and P. Lim when the taxon was first found. Additional collections should be made at these and other sites where the species is found, to properly document its continued existence and spread.
