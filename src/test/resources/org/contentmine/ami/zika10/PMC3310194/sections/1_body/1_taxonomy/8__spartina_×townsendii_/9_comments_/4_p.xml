 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75" class="xref">Hitchcock et al. (1969)</xref> noted a single known population of 
 <italic class="italic">
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>

 <italic class="italic">
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
 </italic> were not distinguished taxonomically, and it is not explicitly clear from the flora which form of the taxon was known from the site. A specimen collected in 1965 from this population [Austenson s.n. (WTU, Suppl. Fig. 35)] is here confirmed to be the F1 sterile hybrid

  <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>

 <italic class="italic">
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
 </italic> requires confirmation (Snohomish Co., Davis Slough west of Stanwood, 25 Aug 1990, M.Arnot 254, WTU-317391, not seen). A 2005 collection from Washington originally identified as 
 <italic class="italic">
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
 </italic> (Giblin &amp; Legler 270 WTU) is here re-determined to be

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17" class="xref">Barkworth (2003)</xref> included

  <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
 </italic> in her treatment of 
 <italic class="italic">
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina</named-content>
 </italic> for North America, but did not include a distribution map or otherwise indicate a range for the species, suggesting some confusion in the literature on its status in North America. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85" class="xref">Kozloff (2005)</xref> also included 
 <italic class="italic">
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina ×townsendii</named-content>
 </italic> (as well as 
 <italic class="italic">
  <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina anglica</named-content>
 </italic>) in his Pacific Northwest flora, indicating only ‘coastal salt marshes’ for its distribution. There apparently are no published data on the current status of the Stanwood population. If the population at Stanwood persists, new collections should be made to document its continued existence at the site, and if other populations are known or discovered, herbarium collections should be made to document their existences.
