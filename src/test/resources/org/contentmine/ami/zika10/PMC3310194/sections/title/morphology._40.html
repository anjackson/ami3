            <div>Spartina gracilis</div></span> is a distinctive taxon (
         <a>Fig. 8</a>). In the Pacific Northwest it is likely to be most readily confused with 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span>, which also grows inland. It is distinguished from 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span> by the following combination of characters: upper glumes unawned or short-awned,
         awns to 2 mm long [vs. distinctly awned upper glumes, awns 3–8 mm long], ciliate glume
         keels [vs. pectinate glume keels], spikelets 6–11 mm long [vs. 10–25 mm long], ligules
         0.5–1 mm long [vs. 1–3 mm long], 3–12 branches per inflorescence [vs. 5–50 branches
         per inflorescence], and 10–30 spikelets per branch [vs. 10–80 spikelets per branch].
         It is distinguished from 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina patens</div></span> by its ciliate glume keels [vs. scabrous glume keels], inconspicuous lateral veins
         on the upper glumes [vs. conspicuous lateral veins on the upper glumes], most branches
         3–6 mm wide [vs. most branches 2–3 mm wide], branches closely appressed to the main
         axis [vs. branches appressed, ascending or spreading from main axis], and florets
         more or less equaling the upper glumes in length [vs. florets shorter than the upper
         glumes]. 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina gracilis</div></span> can be readily separated from 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span>, 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> and 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> by its scabrous leaf margins [vs. glabrous leaf margins], and from 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina densiflora</div></span> by its rhizomatous habit [vs. cespitose].
