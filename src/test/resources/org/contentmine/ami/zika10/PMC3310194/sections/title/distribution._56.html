            <div>Spartina pectinata</div></span> is widespread across much of North America north of Mexico, distributed in southern
         Alberta, eastern Washington and Oregon, south to Texas, and east to Newfoundland and
         Labrador (
         <a>Barkworth 2003</a>). It grows in marshes, slough and floodplains, in dry prairies and along roads (
         <a>Barkworth 2003</a>). It is known from a few scattered sites in Britain and Ireland where it has been
         introduced and escaped from cultivation (
         <a>Cope and Gray 2009</a>).
