            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> is often misspelled in the literature as “Spartina alternifolia”. 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> was described from Bayonne in southwestern France (
         <a>Loiseleur-Deslongchamps 1807</a>), where it has been introduced for over two centuries. The taxon was collected in
         France as early as 1803, and was known from southern England (Southampton Water) by
         1829; it is presumed to have been introduced from North America to these European
         coastal regions in shipping ballast (see 
         <a>Bromfield 1836</a>, Marchant 1968). 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> is one of the parents of the sterile F1 hybrid 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> (see notes under this taxon), which was formed when this introduced species hybridized
         with the European Atlantic coast native species 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina maritima</div></span>. By 1969 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> was extremely rare in Southampton Water, known from only a single locality (
         <a>Marchant and Goodman 1969a</a>, 
         <a>1969b</a>), and it remains rare in Britain (
         <a>Cope and Gray 2009</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several introductions of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> have occurred along the west coast of North America where it is not native. The species
         was reported in 1945 from a single estuarial location in Willapa Bay, Washington,
         where occasional plants had been observed since around 1911, and thought to have been
         introduced in the early twentieth century with oyster culture (
         <a>Scheffer 1945</a>). The earliest known record documenting 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> at Willapa Bay is a photograph taken in the early 1940s by T. Scheffer, housed at
         the California Academy of Sciences Herbarium (
         <a>Civille et al. 2005</a>). Based on a review of historical records of the oyster trade, 
         <a>Civille et al. (2005)</a> concluded that 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> was probably introduced to Willapa Bay between 1893 and the late 1910s via seeds
          attached to oysters during their railway transport from the Atlantic coast to the
         Pacific coast. Since the mid-twentieth century 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> has expanded dramatically in Willapa Bay and northwards to Grays Harbour and the
         Copalis River estuary in Washington (
         <a>Stiller and Denton 1995</a>), radically transforming these tidal ecosystems from mudflats to dense cordgrass
         swards (e.g., 
         <a>Feist and Simenstad 2000</a>, 
         <a>Davis et al. 2004a</a>, 
         <a>2004b</a>). 
         <a>Civille et al. (2005)</a> used historical records and remote sensing to reconstruct the dramatic expansion
         of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> that occurred in Willapa Bay between 1945 and 2000, and concluded that its rapid
         colonization likely originated from multiple introductions over several decades, as
         opposed to the long-standing hypothesis of post-establishment colonization following
         a single introduction to the region (e.g., 
         <a>Scheffer 1945</a>, 
         <a>Stiller and Denton 1995</a>, 
         <a>Feist and Simenstad 2000</a>). Considerable research has been conducted on understanding the invasion dynamics
         of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> in Willapa Bay (e.g., 
         <a>Davis et al. 2004a</a>, 
         <a>2004b</a>, 
         <a>Taylor and Hastings 2004</a>, 
         <a>Grosholz et al. 2009</a>), and substantial efforts and resources have been directed at its management, control
         and eradication (e.g., 
         <a>Grevstad et al. 2003</a>, 
         <a>Taylor and Hastings 2004</a>). 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> is also known from the southern end of Padilla Bay in northwestern Washington, where
         it was apparently introduced independently between 1941 and 1945 to aid in beach stabilization
         (see 
         <a>Wiggins and Binney 1987</a>, 
         <a>Riggs 1992</a>). 
         <a>Stiller and Denton (1995)</a> confirmed the genetic distinctiveness of this stand compared with the Willapa Bay
         population, supporting its putative independent origin.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Oregon, 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> has been reported from the Siuslaw River estuary and Coos Bay (
         <a>Howard 2005</a>; 
         <a>Wilson et al. 2012</a>). In California 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> occurs in southeastern San Francisco Bay (Alameda Creek Flood Control Channel and
         along the shoreline some three km south) where it was planted for restoration in the
         late 1970s (
         <a>Spicher and Josselyn 1985</a>, 
         <a>Ayres et al. 2003</a>). By some 20 years later it had spread considerably, and was known from seven different
         areas in San Francisco Bay (
         <a>Callaway and Josselyn 1992</a>). 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> has also been reported from Bolina’s Lagoon and Point Reye’s National Seashore north
         of San Francisco Bay; these occurrences are thought to have originated from floating
         seed originating in San Francisco Bay, but this hypothesis has not been confirmed
         (
         <a>Ayres et al. 2003</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The only native 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina</div></span> taxon in California is 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina foliosa</div></span>, and by the 1990s it was known that 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> was in the process of competitively excluding 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina foliosa</div></span> (
         <a>Callaway and Josselyn 1992</a>). Substantial evidence has accumulated indicating that the two taxa have successfully
         interbred producing a highly invasive fertile hybrid capable of backcrossing with
         its parental taxa, resulting in a genetically heterogeneous hybrid cordgrass swarm
         (i.e., 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflor</div></span>a × 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina foliosa</div></span>) that is much more invasive than either parental taxon (
         <a>Daehler and Strong 1997</a>, 
         <a>Ayres et al. 1999</a>, 
         <a>2003</a>, 
         <a>2004</a>, 
         <a>Anttila et al. 2000</a>). Morphological variation of these hybrids is not well characterized in the literature.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> is not known from British Columbia, Canada. 
         <a>Daehler and Strong (1996)</a> identified estuaries along the Pacific coast extending to the Canada / United States
         border, which they predicted to be potentially vulnerable to invasion by 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina</div></span> species, including 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span>. Workers should be aware of the potential 
         for its invasion and keep watch for the species in British Columbia. In a recent study
         of saltmarsh diatoms in central mainland British Columbia some 40 km northeast of
         Vancouver Island, 
         <a>Roe et al. (2009)</a> reported 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> as a dominant species in low and mid marsh components of Waump (
         
         <div>51°11'15N, 126°55'15W</div>) and Wawwat’l saltmarshes (
         
         <div>51°11'36N, 126°40'5W</div>) in Seymour Inlet, based on fieldwork conducted in 2002. If the species is correctly
         identified as 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> in this study, this would be the first known site of the taxon in British Columbia.
         Alternatively, the taxon may be 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina anglica</div></span>, but it is not possible to further confirm its identification based on the study
         (voucher specimens are not mentioned). 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina</div></span> has not otherwise been reported from Seymour Inlet. This region should be re-visited
         for further field study and collection of voucher specimens. Whatever the identity
         of the species is, this report suggests that by 2002 invasive 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina</div></span> was present in coastal British Columbia at sites further north than those first documented
         in 2003 near the international border south of Vancouver.
