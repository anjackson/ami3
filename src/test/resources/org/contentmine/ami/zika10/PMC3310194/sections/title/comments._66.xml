 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the mid to late 1800s an unknown cordgrass of restricted distribution appeared and spread rapidly along the shores of Southampton Water, England (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B133" href="#B133">Stapf 1914</a>), which differed morphologically (particularly by its sterile pollen) from

  </span>, the single cordgrass species native to the Atlantic coast of Europe and north Africa (

  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina alterniflora</div>
  </span>, which had been present in the region since the early part of the 19
  <span class="sup">th</span> century. The brothers Henry and James Grove (1881) described this taxon as 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina townsendii</div>
  </span> from plants collected near Hythe. In the 1890s a second form of 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina townsendii</div>
  </span>, which was recognized and considered distinct by having fertile stamens, was collected at multiple localities in the region, and by the mid twentieth century it had expanded substantially on tidal flats across the British Isles (see 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B58" href="#B58">Goodman et al. 1959</a>,

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B79" href="#B79">1965</a>). For decades these two forms (one sterile, the other fertile) of 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina townsendii</div>
  </span> were referred to collectively as the 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina townsendii</div>
  </span> aggregate or 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina townsendii</div>
  </span> sensu lato. Because of its vigorous growth and ability to rapidly colonize and stabilize mud flats, 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina townsendii</div>
  </span> s.l. was considered to be a “useful” species and was distributed and planted widely for land reclamation, coastal protection, and animal feed across the British Isles, Europe, and in New Zealand (e.g., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B105" href="#B105">Oliver 1925</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soon after its formal description 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina townsendii</div>
  </span> was considered to be a species of hybrid origin. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B53" href="#B53">Foucaud (1894)</a> suggested that 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina townsendii</div>

  </span> and the introduced 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina alterniflora</div>
  </span>, a hypothesis later supported by 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B133" href="#B133">Stapf (1914)</a> and Huskins (1930), who examined cytological evidence and hypothesized that fertile plants of 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina townsendii</div>
  </span> s.l. originated from chromosome doubling following hybridization between its parent species. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B90" href="#B90">Marchant (1963)</a> confirmed this work, and reported chromosome numbers as 2

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B78" href="#B78">Hubbard (1957)</a> observed the type specimen of 
  <span class="italic">

  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina anglica</div>

  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina alterniflora</div>
  </span> as the female parent and

  </span> (e.g., Chevalier 1923,

   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina ×neyrautii</div>
  </span>,with the same parentage as

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B21" href="#B21">Baumel et al. (2003)</a> confirmed this with molecular data, demonstrating that

  </span> and 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina ×townsendii</div>

  </span>) and paternal (
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina maritima</div>

  </span> is a synonym of

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B115" href="#B115">Raybould et al. (1990)</a>. In recent decades it has been documented that these hybrid plants are highly restricted in distribution in

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B75" href="#B75">Hitchcock et al. (1969)</a> noted a single known population of

  </span> requires confirmation (Snohomish Co., Davis Slough west of Stanwood, 25 Aug 1990, M.Arnot 254, WTU-317391, not seen). A 2005 collection from Washington originally identified as 
  <span class="italic">

If the population at Stanwood persists, new collections should be made to document its continued existence at the site, and if other populations are known or discovered, herbarium collections should be made to document their existences.
