   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina alterniflora</div>
  </span> is often misspelled in the literature as “Spartina alternifolia”. 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina alterniflora</div>
  </span> was described from Bayonne in southwestern France (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B89" href="#B89">Loiseleur-Deslongchamps 1807</a>), where it has been introduced for over two centuries. The taxon was collected in France as early as 1803, and was known from southern England (Southampton Water) by 1829; it is presumed to have been introduced from North America to these European coastal regions in shipping ballast (see 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">Bromfield 1836</a>, Marchant 1968). 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina alterniflora</div>
  </span> is one of the parents of the sterile F1 hybrid 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina ×townsendii</div>
  </span> (see notes under this taxon), which was formed when this introduced species hybridized with the European Atlantic coast native species 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina maritima</div>
  </span>. By 1969 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina alterniflora</div>
  </span> was extremely rare in Southampton Water, known from only a single locality (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B95" href="#B95">1969b</a>), and it remains rare in Britain (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several introductions of 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina alterniflora</div>
  </span> have occurred along the west coast of North America where it is not native. The species was reported in 1945 from a single estuarial location in Willapa Bay, Washington, where occasional plants had been observed since around 1911, and thought to have been introduced in the early twentieth century with oyster culture (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B130" href="#B130">Scheffer 1945</a>). The earliest known record documenting 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina alterniflora</div>
  </span> at Willapa Bay is a photograph taken in the early 1940s by T. Scheffer, housed at the California Academy of Sciences Herbarium (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">Civille et al. 2005</a>). Based on a review of historical records of the oyster trade, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">Civille et al. (2005)</a> concluded that 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina alterniflora</div>
  </span> was probably introduced to Willapa Bay between 1893 and the late 1910s via seeds
  <!--PageBreak--> attached to oysters during their railway transport from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast. Since the mid-twentieth century 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina alterniflora</div>
  </span> has expanded dramatically in Willapa Bay and northwards to Grays Harbour and the Copalis River estuary in Washington (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B135" href="#B135">Stiller and Denton 1995</a>), radically transforming these tidal ecosystems from mudflats to dense cordgrass swards (e.g., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B50" href="#B50">Feist and Simenstad 2000</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B41" href="#B41">Davis et al. 2004a</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B42" href="#B42">2004b</a>). 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">Civille et al. (2005)</a> used historical records and remote sensing to reconstruct the dramatic expansion of 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina alterniflora</div>
  </span> that occurred in Willapa Bay between 1945 and 2000, and concluded that its rapid colonization likely originated from multiple introductions over several decades, as opposed to the long-standing hypothesis of post-establishment colonization following a single introduction to the region (e.g., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B130" href="#B130">Scheffer 1945</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B135" href="#B135">Stiller and Denton 1995</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B50" href="#B50">Feist and Simenstad 2000</a>). Considerable research has been conducted on understanding the invasion dynamics of 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina alterniflora</div>
  </span> in Willapa Bay (e.g., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B41" href="#B41">Davis et al. 2004a</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B42" href="#B42">2004b</a>,

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B63" href="#B63">Grosholz et al. 2009</a>), and substantial efforts and resources have been directed at its management, control and eradication (e.g., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B61" href="#B61">Grevstad et al. 2003</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B138" href="#B138">Taylor and Hastings 2004</a>). 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina alterniflora</div>
  </span> is also known from the southern end of Padilla Bay in northwestern Washington, where it was apparently introduced independently between 1941 and 1945 to aid in beach stabilization (see 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B139" href="#B139">Wiggins and Binney 1987</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B119" href="#B119">Riggs 1992</a>). 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B135" href="#B135">Stiller and Denton (1995)</a> confirmed the genetic distinctiveness of this stand compared with the Willapa Bay population, supporting its putative independent origin.

   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina alterniflora</div>

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B142" href="#B142">Wilson et al. 2012</a>). In California 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina alterniflora</div>
  </span> occurs in southeastern San Francisco Bay (Alameda Creek Flood Control Channel and along the shoreline some three km south) where it was planted for restoration in the late 1970s (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B12" href="#B12">Ayres et al. 2003</a>). By some 20 years later it had spread considerably, and was known from seven different areas in San Francisco Bay (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B28" href="#B28">Callaway and Josselyn 1992</a>). 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina alterniflora</div>
  </span> has also been reported from Bolina’s Lagoon and Point Reye’s National Seashore north of San Francisco Bay; these occurrences are thought to have originated from floating seed originating in San Francisco Bay, but this hypothesis has not been confirmed (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B12" href="#B12">Ayres et al. 2003</a>).

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B28" href="#B28">Callaway and Josselyn 1992</a>). Substantial evidence has accumulated indicating that the two taxa have successfully interbred producing a highly invasive fertile hybrid capable of backcrossing with its parental taxa, resulting in a genetically heterogeneous hybrid cordgrass swarm (i.e.,

  </span>a ×
