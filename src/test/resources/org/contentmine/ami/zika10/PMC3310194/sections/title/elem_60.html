            and spread rapidly along the shores of Southampton Water, England (
            <a>Stapf 1914</a>), which differed morphologically (particularly by its sterile pollen) from 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina maritima</div></span>, the single cordgrass species native to the Atlantic coast of Europe and north Africa
            (

            <span>
               <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span>, which had been present in the region since the early part of the 19
            <span>th</span> century. The brothers Henry and James Grove (1881) described this taxon as 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span> from plants collected near Hythe. In the 1890s a second form of 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span>, which was recognized and considered distinct by having fertile stamens, was collected
            at multiple localities in the region, and by the mid twentieth century it had expanded
            substantially on tidal flats across the British Isles (see 
            <a>Goodman et al. 1959</a>, 
            <a>Hubbard 1957</a>, 
            <a>1965</a>). For decades these two forms (one sterile, the other fertile) of

               <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span> were referred to collectively as the

            <span>
               <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span> s.l. was considered to be a “useful” species and was distributed and planted widely
            for land reclamation, coastal protection, and animal feed across the British Isles,
            Europe, and in New Zealand (e.g.,

            <span>
               <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span> was considered to be a species of hybrid origin. 
            <a>Foucaud (1894)</a> suggested that 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span> was probably a hybrid of the native

            <a>Stapf (1914)</a> and Huskins (1930), who examined cytological evidence and hypothesized that fertile
            plants of 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span> s.l. originated from chromosome doubling following hybridization between its parent
            species. 
            <a>Marchant (1963)</a> confirmed this work, and reported chromosome numbers as 2

               <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span> have been confirmed by multiple lines of molecular evidence (

            <a>Hubbard (1957)</a> observed the type specimen of 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina townsendii</div></span> to be the sterile F1 hybrid, and the taxon was subsequently referred to as 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span>. The fertile plants remained without a name until

            <span>
               <div>Spartina anglica</div></span>, and the two forms have since been recognized as distinct taxa. Molecular data have
            identified 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span> as the female parent and 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina maritima</div></span> as the male parent in the origin of

               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> is documented in France. In 1894 Jules Foucaud described 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina neyrautii</div></span> Fouc. from southwestern France and northern Spain. 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina neyrautii</div></span> was initially considered to be a variant of

            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×neyrautii</div></span>,with the same parentage as

            <a>Marchant 1977</a>). 
            <a>Baumel et al. (2003)</a> confirmed this with molecular data, demonstrating that

               <div>Spartina ×neyrautii</div></span> and 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> originated independently by hybridization between the same maternal (

            <span>
               <div>Spartina maritima</div></span>) taxa. Because both taxa apply to the hybrid 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina alterniflora × S. maritima</div></span>, the later name 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×neyrautii</div></span> is a synonym of 
            <span>

            <a>McNeill et al. 2006</a>), and as noted earlier by 
            <a>Raybould et al. (1990)</a>. In recent decades it has been documented that these hybrid plants are highly restricted

               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> has been introduced into North America, where apparently only a single occurrence
            has been reported in the literature. 
            <a>Hitchcock et al. (1969)</a> noted a single known population of 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> in Washington at Stanwood, Snohomish Co. At the time of that publication, the fertile
            (=
            <span>
               <div>Spartina anglica</div></span>) and non-fertile forms of 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> were not distinguished taxonomically, and it is not explicitly clear from the flora
            which form of the taxon was known from the site. A specimen collected in 1965 from
            this population [Austenson s.n. (WTU, Suppl. Fig. 35)] is here confirmed to be the
            F1 sterile hybrid 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span>. The determination of a more recent collection from the Stanwood area identified
            as 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> requires confirmation (Snohomish Co., Davis Slough west of Stanwood, 25 Aug 1990,
            M.Arnot 254, WTU-317391, not seen). A 2005 collection from Washington originally identified
            as 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> (Giblin &amp; Legler 270 WTU) is here re-determined to be 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina anglica</div></span>. 
            <a>Barkworth (2003)</a> included 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> in her treatment of 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina</div></span> for North America, but did not include a distribution map or otherwise indicate a
            range for the species, suggesting some confusion in the literature on its status in
            North America. 
            <a>Kozloff (2005)</a> also included 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> (as well as 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina anglica</div></span>) in his Pacific Northwest flora, indicating only ‘coastal salt marshes’ for its distribution.
            There apparently are no published data on the current status of the Stanwood population.
            If the population at Stanwood persists, new collections should be made to document
            its continued existence at the site, and if other populations are known or discovered,
            herbarium collections should be made to document their existences.

            of these collections were initially determined (incorrectly) as 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> and 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina alterniflora</div></span>, since 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> was not expected in British Columbia. Subsequent study of this material, in combination
            with the 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina</div></span> taxonomic literature and comparisons with specimens of 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> and Old World specimens of 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> at CAN and UBC, confirmed the specimens to be 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span>, prompting the current taxonomic study. Pollen in these specimens is sterile, as
            determined by pollen staining (see discussion under 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina anglica</div></span>, 
            <a>Fig. 5</a>), further confirming their identities as 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span>. Specimens from which pollen was extracted and stained with lactophenol cotton blue
            to assess fertility are identified with the symbol † in the Specimens Examined below.

            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> in British Columbia is not known, and there are no data on the extent of the Boundary
            Bay sub-populations in 2006 aside from notes on the Saarela and Percy collection label
            indicating a single clump of the grass approximately one meter in diameter. It is
            not known if 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span>has persisted in 
            British Columbia since collected some five years ago. Since major efforts are ongoing
            to remove 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina</div></span> plants from Boundary Bay where 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span>was found, it is possible the original stands from which the specimens were collected
            have been removed. The region should be studied to determine if the taxon is present.
            Since the taxon is sterile and does not set seed, it must have been introduced into
            Boundary Bay by vegetative reproduction, probably from rhizome fragments transported
            in tidal currents. It is possible that the British Columbia plants originated from
            the stand at Stanwood, Washington, if it persists, or there may be other extant occurrences
            of 
            <span>

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The description here is based on the first known collection from Washington, the two
            collections from British Columbia, and Old World material housed at CAN and UBC (see
            Specimens Examined), including collections made by H. &amp; J. Groves who first described
            the taxon over a century ago. The North American specimens of 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> are morphologically similar to the Old World specimens examined. 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> is distinguished from 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> by its shorter spikelets [(14–17.5 mm long vs. (15–)16.5–25 mm long]; shorter anthers
            [5–7(–8.5) mm long vs. 7–10 mm long]; indehiscent anthers that are not or incompletely
            exserted with sterile pollen [vs. dehiscent anthers that are usually fully exserted
            with fertile pollen; see 
            <a>Figs 4</a>, 
            <a>5</a>]; shorter ligules [1–1.5 mm long vs. 1–3 mm long]; upper glumes 3-veined [vs. upper
            glumes 3–6-veined]; and shorter upper glumes [12.5–16.5 mm long vs. 13–22 mm long].
            The angle of the leaf blade with the stem is 30–40° in 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span>, compared to 30–60° in 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> (
            <a>Marchant 1968a</a>). This character can be difficult to evaluate on herbarium specimens depending on
            how they were pressed, but should be more reliable in the field for distinguishing
            the taxa, particularly if they occur together. If stands of 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> are relocated in British Columbia or elsewhere in the region, the taxonomic utility
            of this character should be carefully evaluated. 
            <a>Marchant (1968a)</a> noted swards of 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina ×townsendii</div></span> to be distinct in appearance from swards of 
            <span>
               <div>Spartina anglica</div></span> in England, having high culm density and high tiller density (ca. 96/100 cm
