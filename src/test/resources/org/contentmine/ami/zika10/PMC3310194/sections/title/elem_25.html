               <div>Spartina densiflora</div></span> is present in California, Washington, and British Columbia. It was first established
            in California. It occurs in Humboldt Bay, where it is thought to have been introduced
            by shipping in the late 1800s (
            <a>Spicher and Josselyn 1985</a>, Kittleson and Boyd 1997). Prior to the early 1980s, this population was erroneously

               <div>Spartina foliosa</div></span> (

            Bay (see 
            <a>Faber 2000</a>), and independently to Richardson Bay. Hybrids between

               <div>Spartina densiflora</div></span> was documented in Washington a decade ago. The first collection was made in 2001
            on Whidbey Island at the northern boundary of Puget Sound (Heimer 01-1 WTU, UBC).
            
            <a>Caplow (2002)</a> reported a 1/10 acre infestation of

            covering some 10 acres (

               <div>Spartina densiflora</div></span> is now invading British Columbia, where it was first found in 2005 in Bayne’s Sound,
            a channel between Vancouver Island and Denman Island (
            <a>Morgan and Sytsma 2010</a>). It is not reported for the province in several recent floras that consider the
            region (
            <a>Douglas et al. 2001</a>, 
            <a>Barkworth 2003</a>, 
            <a>Kozloff 2005</a>), but is included in the online E-Flora BC (
            <a>Anonymous 2011</a>). In the Bayne’s Sound region, only a few herbarium collections documenting the species
            have been made; these are from Fanny Bay (Lomer 5723, CAN, 
            <a>Fig. 6</a>) and the Buckley Bay Ferry Terminal (Lomer 7377, CAN). Some data on the extent of
            the invasion are given by 
            <a>Morgan and Sytsma (2010)</a> and Dresen et al. (2010), who mapped the species in Bayne’s Sound where the extent
            of its local distribution ranges from individual plants to multiple five meter patches.
            Detailed characterization of this invasion has not otherwise appeared in the literature.
