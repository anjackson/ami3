            <div>Spartina densiflora</div></span> is reviewed by 
         <a>Bortolus (2006)</a>. The synonymy presented here is not complete; several taxa described from South America
         are considered to be synonyms by 
         <a>Mobberley (1956)</a>, including 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina montevidensis</div></span> Arech. (see 
         <a>Carrasco et al. 2002</a> for the location of a probable type specimen), 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina patagonica</div></span> Speg., and several taxa described by 
         <a>St-Yves (1932)</a>. A modern taxonomic revision is needed for 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina densiflora</div></span> to clarify its taxonomy and morphological variation throughout its range (
         <a>Bortolus 2006</a>), particularly given its rapidly increasing global footprint.

         <span>
            <div>Spartina densiflora</div></span> is present in California, Washington, and British Columbia. It was first established
         in California. It occurs in Humboldt Bay, where it is thought to have been introduced
         by shipping in the late 1800s (
         <a>Spicher and Josselyn 1985</a>, Kittleson and Boyd 1997). Prior to the early 1980s, this population was erroneously
         thought to be a native form of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina foliosa</div></span> (
         <a>Bortolus 2008</a>), and seed collected from plants growing in Humboldt Bay was introduced to San Francisco
         Bay (see 
         <a>Faber 2000</a>), and independently to Richardson Bay. Hybrids between 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina densiflora</div></span> and 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina foliosa</div></span> have been confirmed recently from San Francisco Bay in a region where both parental
         species are present (
         <a>Ayres et al. 2008</a>). These are not well characterized morphologically in the literature.

            <div>Spartina densiflora</div></span> was documented in Washington a decade ago. The first collection was made in 2001
         on Whidbey Island at the northern boundary of Puget Sound (Heimer 01-1 WTU, UBC).
         
         <a>Caplow (2002)</a> reported a 1/10 acre infestation of 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina densiflora</div></span> at the west end of Grays Harbor (
         
         <div>46.9408°N, 124.04583°W</div>) in the southeastern part of the state. By 2006 this infestation had expanded substantially,
         covering some 10 acres (
         <a>Murphy et al. 2007</a>). 
         <a>Kozloff (2005)</a> included 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina densiflora</div></span> in his 
         <span>
            <div>Spartina</div></span> treatment, noting only ‘coastal salt marshes’ as its distribution.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span>
            <div>Spartina densiflora</div></span> is now invading British Columbia, where it was first found in 2005 in Bayne’s Sound,
         a channel between Vancouver Island and Denman Island (
         <a>Morgan and Sytsma 2010</a>). It is not reported for the province in several recent floras that consider the
         region (
         <a>Douglas et al. 2001</a>, 
         <a>Barkworth 2003</a>, 
         <a>Kozloff 2005</a>), but is included in the online E-Flora BC (
         <a>Anonymous 2011</a>). In the Bayne’s Sound region, only a few herbarium collections documenting the species
         have been made; these are from Fanny Bay (Lomer 5723, CAN, 
         <a>Fig. 6</a>) and the Buckley Bay Ferry Terminal (Lomer 7377, CAN). Some data on the extent of
         the invasion are given by 
         <a>Morgan and Sytsma (2010)</a> and Dresen et al. (2010), who mapped the species in Bayne’s Sound where the extent
         of its local distribution ranges from individual plants to multiple five meter patches.
         Detailed characterization of this invasion has not otherwise appeared in the literature.
