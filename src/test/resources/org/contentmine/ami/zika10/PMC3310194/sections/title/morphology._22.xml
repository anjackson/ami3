 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The description here is based on collections from Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia, and Old World material housed at CAN and UBC (see Specimens Examined). 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina anglica</div>
  </span> is morphologically similar to 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina ×townsendii</div>
  </span>, and the two can be challenging to distinguish. Differences between these species were characterized in detail by 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B91" href="#B91">Marchant (1968a)</a>, and my observations here are in general accordance with his findings. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B99" href="#B99">Mobberley (1956)</a> commented only briefly on their differences in his treatment of 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina ×townsendii</div>
  </span>, the name under which both ploidal forms of the taxon were recognized at the time. Only a few taxonomic keys in North America include both taxa (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B85" href="#B85">Kozloff 2005</a>), emphasizing variation in ligule

  <!--PageBreak-->length, anther length, and anther dehiscence for identification. In addition to these characters, the key presented here includes spikelet length, upper glume venation, and upper glume length.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, plants of 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina anglica</div>
  </span> tend to be larger than those of 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina ×townsendii</div>
  </span>, including the lengths of reproductive structures useful in distinguishing the taxa. The species can be distinguished with careful measurements on herbarium specimens, though there is some overlap in the diagnostic morphological characteristics. When making a determination, multiple characters should be examined and multiple measurements should be made on a single plant when possible.

  </span> is distinguished from 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina ×townsendii</div>
  </span> by its longer spikelets [(15–)16.5–25 mm long vs. 14–17.5 mm long]; longer anthers [7–10 mm long vs. 5–7(–8.5) mm long]; anthers that are fully exserted and dehiscent [vs. anthers that are not or incompletely exserted and indehiscent; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>]; fertile pollen [vs. sterile pollen (see below and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>)]; longer ligules [1–3 mm long vs. 1–1.5 mm long]; 3–6-veined upper glumes [vs. 3-veined upper glumes]; and longer upper glumes [13–22 mm long vs. 12.5–16.5 mm long]. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B91" href="#B91">Marchant (1968a)</a> observed that leaf blade angle with respect to the culm can be used to differentiate the taxa, as the blades tend to be more erect in 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina ×townsendii</div>
  </span> [blades forming an angle 30–40° with respect to the culm] and more spreading in S. 
  <span class="italic">anglica</span> [blades forming an angle of 30–60°with respect to the culm], and this character is noted in many of the recent field identification resources for the Pacific Northwest. Leaf angle is sometimes difficult to determine on herbarium specimens. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B91" href="#B91">Marchant (1968a)</a> also noted swards of 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina anglica</div>
  </span> in the field (in England) differed from swards of 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Spartina ×townsendii</div>
  </span> as being less dense in tillers (ca. 52/100 cm
  <span class="sup">2 </span>vs. ca. 96/100 cm
  <span class="sup">2</span>) and having more robust but fewer rhizomes.
