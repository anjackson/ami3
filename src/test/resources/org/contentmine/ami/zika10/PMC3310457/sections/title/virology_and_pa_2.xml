 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ZIKV is an RNA virus containing 10,794 nucleotides encoding 3,419 amino acids. It is closely related to Spondweni virus; the 2 viruses are the only members of their clade within the mosquito-borne cluster of flaviviruses (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Information regarding pathogenesis of ZIKV is scarce but mosquito-borne flaviviruses are thought to replicate initially in dendritic cells near the site of inoculation then spread to lymph nodes and the bloodstream (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="R24" href="#R24">
   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>). Although flaviviral replication is thought to occur in cellular cytoplasm, 1 study suggested that ZIKV antigens could be found in infected cell nuclei (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="R25" href="#R25">
   <span class="italic">25</span>
  </a>). To date, infectious ZIKV has been detected in human blood as early as the day of illness onset; viral nucleic acid has been detected as late as 11 days after onset (
