      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the virus has spread outside Africa and Asia, ZIKV should be considered an
         emerging pathogen. Fortunately, ZIKV illness to date has been mild and self-limited,
         but before West Nile virus caused large outbreaks of neuroinvasive disease in Romania
         and in North America, it was also considered to be a relatively innocuous pathogen
         (
         <a><span>28</span></a>). The discovery of ZIKV on the physically isolated community of Yap Island is testimony
         to the potential for travel or commerce to spread the virus across large distances.
         A medical volunteer who was on Yap Island during the ZIKV disease outbreak became
         ill and was likely viremic with ZIKV after her return to the United States (
         <a><span>2</span></a>). The competence of mosquitoes in the Americas for ZIKV is not known and this question
         should be addressed. Spread of ZIKV across the Pacific could be difficult to detect
         because of the cross-reactivity of diagnostic flavivirus antibody assays. ZIKV disease
         could easily be confused with dengue and might contribute to illness during dengue
         outbreaks. Recognition of the spread of ZIKV and of the impact of ZIKV on human health
         will require collaboration between clinicians, public health officials, and high-quality
         reference laboratories.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given that the epidemiology of ZIKV transmission on Yap Island appeared to be similar
         to that of dengue, strategies for prevention and control of ZIKV disease should include
         promoting the use of insect repellent and interventions to reduce the abundance of
         potential mosquito vectors. Officials responsible for public health surveillance in
         the Pacific region and the United States should be alert to the potential spread of
         ZIKV and keep in mind the possible diagnostic confusion between ZIKV illness and dengue.
