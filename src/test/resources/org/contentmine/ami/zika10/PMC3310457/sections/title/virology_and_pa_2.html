      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ZIKV is an RNA virus containing 10,794 nucleotides encoding 3,419 amino acids. It
         is closely related to Spondweni virus; the 2 viruses are the only members of their
         clade within the mosquito-borne cluster of flaviviruses (
         <a>Figure 2</a>) (
         <a><span>1</span></a><span>,</span><a><span>21</span></a><span>,</span><a><span>22</span></a>). The next nearest relatives include Ilheus, Rocio, and St. Louis encephalitis viruses;
         yellow fever virus is the prototype of the family, which also includes dengue, Japanese
         encephalitis, and West Nile viruses (
         <a><span>1</span></a><span>,</span><a><span>21</span></a>). Studies in the Zika Forest suggested that ZIKV infection blunted the viremia caused
         by yellow fever virus in monkeys but did not block transmission of yellow fever virus
         (

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Information regarding pathogenesis of ZIKV is scarce but mosquito-borne flaviviruses
         are thought to replicate initially in dendritic cells near the site of inoculation
         then spread to lymph nodes and the bloodstream (
         <a><span>24</span></a>). Although flaviviral replication is thought to occur in cellular cytoplasm, 1 study
         suggested that ZIKV antigens could be found in infected cell nuclei (
         <a><span>25</span></a>). To date, infectious ZIKV has been detected in human blood as early as the day of
         illness onset; viral nucleic acid has been detected as late as 11 days after onset
         (
         <a><span>1</span></a><span>,</span><a><span>26</span></a>). The virus was isolated from the serum of a monkey 9 days after experimental inoculation
         (
         <a><span>5</span></a>). ZIKV is killed by potassium permanganate, ether, and temperatures &gt;60Â°C, but it
         is not effectively neutralized with 10% ethanol (
         <a><span>5</span></a>).
