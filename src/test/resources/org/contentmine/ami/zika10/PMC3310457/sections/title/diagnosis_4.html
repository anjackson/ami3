      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Diagnostic tests for ZIKV infection include PCR tests on acute-phase serum samples,
         which detect viral RNA, and other tests to detect specific antibody against ZIKV in
         serum. An ELISA has been developed at the Arboviral Diagnostic and Reference Laboratory
         of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Ft. Collins, CO, USA) to detect
         immunoglobulin (Ig) M to ZIKV (
         <a><span>1</span></a>). In the samples from Yap Island, cross-reactive results in sera from convalescent-phase
         patients occurred more frequently among patients with evidence of previous flavivirus
         infections than among those with apparent primary ZIKV infections (
         <a><span>1</span></a><span>,</span><a><span>2</span></a>). Cross-reactivity was more frequently noted with dengue virus than with yellow fever,
         Japanese encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis, or West Nile viruses, but there
         were too few samples tested to derive robust estimates of the sensitivity and specificity
         of the ELISA. IgM was detectable as early as 3 days after onset of illness in some
         persons; 1 person with evidence of previous flavivirus infection had not developed
         IgM at day 5 but did have it by day 8 (
         <a><span>1</span></a>). Neutralizing antibody developed as early as 5 days after illness onset. The plaque
         reduction neutralization assay generally has improved specificity over immunoassays,
         but may still yield cross-reactive results in secondary flavivirus infections. PCR
         tests can be conducted on samples obtained less than 10 days after illness onset;
         1 patient from Yap Island still had detectable viral RNA on day 11 (
         <a><span>1</span></a>). In general, diagnostic testing for flavivirus infections should include an acute-phase
         serum sample collected as early as possible after onset of illness and a second sample
         collected 2 to 3 weeks after the first.
