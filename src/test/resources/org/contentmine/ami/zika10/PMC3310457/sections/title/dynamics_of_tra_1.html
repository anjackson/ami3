      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ZIKV has been isolated from 
         <span>Ae. africanus</span>, 
         <span>Ae. apicoargenteus</span>, 
         <span>Ae. luteocephalus</span>, 
         <span>Ae. aegypti</span>, 
         <span>Ae vitattus</span>, and 
         <span>Ae. furcifer</span> mosquitoes (
         <a><span>9</span></a><span>,</span><a><span>15</span></a><span>,</span><a><span>17</span></a><span>,</span><a><span>19</span></a>). 
         <span>Ae. hensilii</span> was the predominant mosquito species present on Yap during the ZIKV disease outbreak
         in 2007, but investigators were unable to detect ZIKV in any mosquitoes on the island
         during the outbreak (
         <a><span>2</span></a>). Dick noted that 
         <span>Ae. africanus</span> mosquitoes, which were abundant and infected with ZIKV in the Zika Forest, were not
         likely to enter monkey cages such as the one containing Rhesus 766 (
         <a><span>5</span></a>) raising the doubt that the monkey might have acquired ZIKV from some other mosquito
         species or through some other mechanism. During the studies of yellow fever in the
         Zika Forest, investigators had to begin tethering monkeys in trees because caged monkeys
         did not acquire yellow fever virus when the virus was present in mosquitoes (
         <a><span>5</span></a>). Thus, despite finding ZIKV in 
         <span>Ae. Africanus</span> mosquitoes, Dick was not sure whether or not these mosquitoes were actually the vector
         for enzootic ZIKV transmission to monkeys.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Boorman and Porterfield subsequently demonstrated transmission of ZIKV to mice and
         monkeys by 
         <span>Ae. aegypti</span> in a laboratory (
         <a><span>6</span></a>). Virus content in the mosquitoes was high on the day of artificial feeding, dropped
         to undetectable levels through day 10 after feeding, had increased by day 15, and
         remained high from days 20 through 60 (
         <a><span>6</span></a>). Their study suggests that the extrinsic incubation period for ZIKV in mosquitoes
         is â‰ˆ10 days. The authors cautioned that their results did not conclusively demonstrate
         that 
         <span>Ae. aegypti</span> mosquitoes could transmit ZIKV at lower levels of viremia than what might occur among
         host animals in natural settings. Nevertheless, their results, along with the viral
         isolations from wild mosquitoes and monkeys and the phylogenetic proximity of ZIKV
         to other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, make it reasonable to conclude that ZIKV is
         transmitted through mosquito bites.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is to date no solid evidence of nonprimate reservoirs of ZIKV, but 1 study did
         find antibody to ZIKV in rodents (
         <a><span>20</span></a>). Further laboratory, field, and epidemiologic studies would be useful to better
         define vector competence for ZIKV, to determine if there are any other arthropod vectors
         or reservoir hosts, and to evaluate the possibility of congenital infection or transmission
         through blood transfusion.
