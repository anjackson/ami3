  <span class="italic">Ae. hensilii</span> was the predominant mosquito species present on Yap during the ZIKV disease outbreak in 2007, but investigators were unable to detect ZIKV in any mosquitoes on the island during the outbreak (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="R2" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>). Dick noted that 
  <span class="italic">Ae. africanus</span> mosquitoes, which were abundant and infected with ZIKV in the Zika Forest, were not likely to enter monkey cages such as the one containing Rhesus 766 (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>) raising the doubt that the monkey might have acquired ZIKV from some other mosquito species or through some other mechanism. During the studies of yellow fever in the Zika Forest, investigators had to begin tethering monkeys in trees because caged monkeys did not acquire yellow fever virus when the virus was present in mosquitoes (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>). Thus, despite finding ZIKV in 
  <span class="italic">Ae. Africanus</span> mosquitoes, Dick was not sure whether or not these mosquitoes were actually the vector for enzootic ZIKV transmission to monkeys.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Boorman and Porterfield subsequently demonstrated transmission of ZIKV to mice and monkeys by 
  <span class="italic">Ae. aegypti</span> in a laboratory (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>). Virus content in the mosquitoes was high on the day of artificial feeding, dropped to undetectable levels through day 10 after feeding, had increased by day 15, and remained high from days 20 through 60 (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>). Their study suggests that the extrinsic incubation period for ZIKV in mosquitoes is â‰ˆ10 days. The authors cautioned that their results did not conclusively demonstrate that 
  <span class="italic">Ae. aegypti</span> mosquitoes could transmit ZIKV at lower levels of viremia than what might occur among host animals in natural settings. Nevertheless, their results, along with the viral isolations from wild mosquitoes and monkeys and the phylogenetic proximity of ZIKV to other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, make it reasonable to conclude that ZIKV is transmitted through mosquito bites.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is to date no solid evidence of nonprimate reservoirs of ZIKV, but 1 study did find antibody to ZIKV in rodents (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>). Further laboratory, field, and epidemiologic studies would be useful to better define vector competence for ZIKV, to determine if there are any other arthropod vectors or reservoir hosts, and to evaluate the possibility of congenital infection or transmission through blood transfusion.
