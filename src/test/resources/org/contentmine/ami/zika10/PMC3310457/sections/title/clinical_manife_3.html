      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first well-documented report of human ZIKV disease was in 1964 when Simpson described
         his own occupationally acquired ZIKV illness at age 28 (
         <a><span>27</span></a>). It began with mild headache. The next day, a maculopapular rash covered his face,
         neck, trunk, and upper arms, and spread to his palms and soles. Transient fever, malaise,
         and back pain developed. By the evening of the second day of illness he was afebrile,
         the rash was fading, and he felt better. By day three, he felt well and had only the
         rash, which disappeared over the next 2 days. ZIKV was isolated from serum collected
         while he was febrile.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1973, Filipe et al. reported laboratory-acquired ZIKV illness in a man with acute
         onset of fever, headache, and joint pain but no rash (
         <a><span>26</span></a>). ZIKV was isolated from serum collected on the first day of symptoms; the man’s
         illness resolved in ≈1 week.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the 7 ZIKV case-patients in Indonesia described by Olson et al. all had fever,
         but they were detected by hospital-based surveillance for febrile illness (
         <a><span>11</span></a>). Other manifestations included anorexia, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain,
         and dizziness. One patient had conjunctivitis but none had rash. The outbreak on Yap
         Island was characterized by rash, conjunctivitis, and arthralgia (
         <a><span>1</span></a><span>,</span><a><span>2</span></a>). Other less frequent manifestations included myalgia, headache, retroorbital pain,
         edema, and vomiting (
         <a><span>2</span></a>).
