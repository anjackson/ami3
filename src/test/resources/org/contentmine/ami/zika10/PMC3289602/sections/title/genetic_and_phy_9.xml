 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nucleotide sequences derived from the five ZIKV strains were assembled and aligned with three other sequences of ZIKV and one sequence of Spondweni virus that were retrieved from GenBank using the Vector NTI Suite (Invitrogen, USA) (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001477-t002" href="#pntd-0001477-t002">Table 2</a>). The two GenBank sequences of the MR766 strain exhibited considerable nucleotide and amino acid variation; therefore we resequenced this strain (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001477-t002" href="#pntd-0001477-t002">Table 2</a>). Phylogenies were generated using neighbor-joining (NJ), maximum-likelihood (ML) and maximum-parsimony (MP) methods using the default settings implemented in the PHYLIP package
