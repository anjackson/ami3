 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to this study, only two ZIKV strains had been genetically characterized 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001477-Kuno1" href="#pntd.0001477-Kuno1">[16]</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001477-Lanciotti1" href="#pntd.0001477-Lanciotti1">[17]</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001477-Grard1" href="#pntd.0001477-Grard1">[22]</a>. Our phylogentic analyses with the inclusion of five newly sequenced strains revealed the existence of two major ZIKV lineages. Analyses showed the basal divergence of the African and Asian lineages. Furthermore, results of the present study show that the FSS13025 (Cambodia, 2010), P6-740 (Malaysia, 1966) and EC Yap (Micronesia, 2007) strains belong to the Asian lineage, suggesting a recent common ancestor.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The clinical similarity of ZIKV infection to classical DEN fever and CHIK fever may be one reason why this disease has rarely been reported in Asia. During World War II, for example, DEN fever was a major medical problem among Allied and Japanese troops in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001477-McCoy1" href="#pntd.0001477-McCoy1">[23]</a>. At that time, there were no specific laboratory tests that could differentiate between the three diseases. In fact, CHIKV and ZIKV still had not been isolated. Consequently, cases of acute febrile illness were likely diagnosed clinically as DEN or possibly as scrub typhus or malaria, diseases that were known and frequently diagnosed among the many foreign military and civilian personnel present in the region at that time 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001477-McCoy1" href="#pntd.0001477-McCoy1">[23]</a>. Carey has reviewed the historical confusion in differentiating DEN fever from CHIK fever 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001477-Carey1" href="#pntd.0001477-Carey1">[24]</a>; but ZIKV infections have probably been misdiagnosed or not reported for some of the same reasons. Given the low level of nucleotide divergence among the ZIKV isolates here (â‰¤11.7%), conserved regions could be utilized for the development of diagnostic assays that will not only aid in detecting new ZIKV infections but to also differentiate them from other arbovirus infections.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results strengthen previous epidemiologic evidence that the EC Yap strain originated in Southeast Asia 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001477-Duffy1" href="#pntd.0001477-Duffy1">[9]</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001477-Lanciotti1" href="#pntd.0001477-Lanciotti1">[17]</a>. This conclusion is further substantiated by the geographic proximity of Yap Island to known areas of ZIKV transmission (Indonesia and Malaysia). It has been reported that wind-blown mosquitoes can travel distances of several hundred kilometers over the open ocean 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001477-Asahina1" href="#pntd.0001477-Asahina1">[25]</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001477-Curry1" href="#pntd.0001477-Curry1">[26]</a>. However, due to the great distances involved, it seems likely that the virus was introduced as a result of travel or trade activities whereby either a viremic person, enzootic host species, and/or an infected and subsequently infective mosquito (adult or immature) was transported to the island as suggested by Duffey 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001477-Duffy1" href="#pntd.0001477-Duffy1">[9]</a>. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that no monkeys were present on Yap Island during the 2007 epidemic 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001477-Duffy1" href="#pntd.0001477-Duffy1">[9]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The phylogenetic results indicate that the Cambodian strain diverged from the Malaysian strain in the recent past. Therefore, the most recent common ancestor of the Cambodian strain has been circulating in Southeast Asia since at least the mid-1900's. These data indicate that Cambodian strain was either recently introduced or that it has been circulating in the region and has remained undetected until 2010. Seroprevalence surveys might help to determine when ZIKV was introduced into Cambodia.</p>
