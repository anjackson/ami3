 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The two MR 766 strains that had been previously sequenced exhibited extensive genetic variation (6.3% nucleotide, 1.8% amino acid divergence) (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001477-t002" href="#pntd-0001477-t002">Table 2</a>). To investigate this discrepancy (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0001477-t002" href="#pntd-0001477-t002">Table 2</a>), we sequenced an additional strain of MR 766 from the WRCEVA collection. The MR 766 sequence with accession number AY632535 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0001477-Kuno1" href="#pntd.0001477-Kuno1">[16]</a>, was ultimately chosen for use in our analyses due to its low passage history, nucleotide and amino acid similarity to the high passage MR 766 strain that we sequenced (0.4% nucleotide and 0.6% amino acid divergence), and its position closest to the root of the MR 766 lineage in a tree including all three sequences (not shown).
