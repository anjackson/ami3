      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The basal position of the ZIKV strain isolated in Malaysia in 1966 suggests that the
         recent outbreak in Micronesia was initiated by a strain from Southeast Asia. Because
         ZIKV infection in humans produces an illness clinically similar to dengue fever and
         many other tropical infectious diseases, it is likely greatly misdiagnosed and underreported.
