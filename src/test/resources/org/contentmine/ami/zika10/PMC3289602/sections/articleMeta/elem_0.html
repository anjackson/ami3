            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus distributed throughout much of Africa
               and Asia. Infection with the virus may cause acute febrile illness that clinically
               resembles dengue fever. A recent study indicated the existence of three geographically
               distinct viral lineages; however this analysis utilized only a single viral gene.
               Although ZIKV has been known to circulate in both Africa and Asia since at least the
               1950s, little is known about the genetic relationships between geographically distinct
               virus strains. Moreover, the geographic origin of the strains responsible for the
               epidemic that occurred on Yap Island, Federated States of Micronesia in 2007, and
               a 2010 pediatric case in Cambodia, has not been determined.

               the origin of the strains responsible for the 2007 outbreak on Yap Island and a 2010
               Cambodian pediatric case of ZIKV infection, the nucleotide sequences of the open reading
               frame of five isolates from Cambodia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Uganda, and Senegal collected
               between 1947 and 2010 were determined. Phylogenetic analyses of these and previously
               published ZIKV sequences revealed the existence of two main virus lineages (African
               and Asian) and that the strain responsible for the Yap epidemic and the Cambodian
               case most likely originated in Southeast Asia. Examination of the nucleotide and amino
               acid sequence alignments revealed the loss of a potential glycosylation site in some
               of the virus strains, which may correlate with the passage history of the virus.

               recent outbreak in Micronesia was initiated by a strain from Southeast Asia. Because
               ZIKV infection in humans produces an illness clinically similar to dengue fever and
               many other tropical infectious diseases, it is likely greatly misdiagnosed and underreported.

         <div>Author Summary</div>
         <p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus found in both Africa and Asia.
            Human infection with the virus may result in a febrile illness similar to dengue fever
            and many other tropical infections found in these regions. Previously, little was
            known about the genetic relationships between ZIKV strains collected in Africa and
            those collected in Asia. In addition, the geographic origins of the strains responsible
            for the recent outbreak of human disease on Yap Island, Federated States of Micronesia,
            and a human case of ZIKV infection in Cambodia were unknown. Our results indicate
            that there are two geographically distinct lineages of ZIKV (African and Asian). The
            virus has circulated in Southeast Asia for at least the past 50 years, whereupon it
            was introduced to Yap Island resulting in an epidemic of human disease in 2007, and
            in 2010 was the cause of a pediatric case of ZIKV infection in Cambodia. This study
            also highlights the danger of ZIKV introduction into new areas and the potential for
            future epidemics of human disease.
