      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the Spondweni serocomplex within the genus 
         <span>Flavivirus</span>, family 
         <span>Flaviviridae</span><a>[1]</a>. Other mosquito-borne flaviviruses of public health importance include yellow fever,
         dengue, St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile and Japanese encephalitis viruses. Although
         research efforts have focused on many of these viruses, other medically important
         members of the mosquito-borne flaviviruses, such as ZIKV, have received far less attention.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Zika virus was first isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey placed in the Zika Forest
         near Lake Victoria, Uganda in April 1947; a second isolation from the mosquito 
         <span>Aedes africanus</span> followed at the same site in January 1948 
         <a>[2]</a>. Since that time, sporadic isolations have been made from humans and a variety of
         mosquito species in both Africa and Asia, with studies of human and animal seroprevalence
         confirming this distribution (
         <a>Table 1</a>). Zika virus is most likely maintained in a sylvatic cycle involving non-human primates
         and mosquitoes 
         <a>[3]</a>, 
         <a>[4]</a>, with cyclic epizootics in monkeys reported in Uganda 
         <a>[5]</a>, 
         <a>[6]</a>, 
         <a>[7]</a>, 
         <a>[8]</a>. In the sylvatic transmission cycle, humans likely serve as incidental hosts. However,
         in areas without non-human primates, humans probably serve as primary amplification
         hosts and potentially as reservoir hosts if their viremia is sufficient in duration
         and magnitude 
         <a>[9]</a>. Although it is thought that enzootic ZIKV is maintained primarily in a monkey/mosquito
         transmission cycle, antibodies have been detected in numerous other animal species
         including water buffalo, elephants, goats, hippos, impala, kongoni, lions, sheep,
         rodents, wildebeest, and zebras

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Human case reports of clinically diagnosed ZIKV infections include self-limiting acute
         febrile illnesses with fever, headache, myalgia and rash, similar to that caused by
         many other arboviruses found throughout the tropics 
         <a>[9]</a>, 
         <a>[11]</a>, 
         <a>[12]</a>, 
         <a>[13]</a>, 
         <a>[14]</a>, 
         <a>[15]</a>. This clinical picture could easily be mistaken for dengue (DEN) or chikungunya (CHIK)
         fevers, two common arboviral infections which both produce similar clinical presentations.
         The latter two infections are much more commonly diagnosed in tropical Africa and
         Asia than ZIKV. Clinical DENV and CHIKV infections are familiar to local clinicians
         and most diagnostic laboratories can detect them. In contrast, few physicians are
         aware of ZIKV and few laboratories test for clinical infection. Consequently, most
         ZIKV infections are probably missed or incorrectly diagnosed, as suggested by the
         high prevalence of ZIKV antibodies found in serosurveys of human populations in Africa
         and Asia (
         <a>Table 1</a>). A recent epidemic on Yap Island, Federated States of Micronesia, and a pediatric
         case of ZIKV infection in Cambodia demonstrate that ZIKV is also capable of causing
         human disease and may be expanding its geographic distribution 
         <a>[9]</a>, 
         <a>[15]</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Zika virus, has a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome approximately 11 kilobases
         in length 
         <a>[16]</a>. The genome contains 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions flanking a single open reading
         frame (ORF) that encodes a polyprotein that is cleaved into three structural proteins:
         the capsid (C), premembrane/membrane (prM), and envelope (E), and seven non-structural
         proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, 2K, NS4B, and NS5) 
         <a>[16]</a>. A previous genetic study using nucleotide sequences derived from the NS5 gene indicated
         three ZIKV lineages: East African (one strain examined), West African (three strains
         examined), and Asian (one strain examined) 
         <a>[17]</a>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although ZIKV circulates widely in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, little is
         known of the genetic relationships among isolates from these two geographic regions,
         which may have different vector/host transmission cycles. Furthermore, the geographic
         origin of the strain responsible for the epidemic on Yap Island epidemic and of the
         recent Cambodian case of ZIKV infection is unknown. To answer these questions, we
         determined the nucleotide sequences of the ORF of five ZIKV strains collected between
         1947 and 2010 in Cambodia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Uganda, and Senegal and constructed
         phylogenetic trees to assess their relationships.
