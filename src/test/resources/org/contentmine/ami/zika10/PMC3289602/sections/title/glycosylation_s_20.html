      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several of the ZIKV strains we analyzed exhibited the deletion of a potential N-linked
         glycosylation site that has been previously described in some ZIKV and West Nile virus
         strains 
         <a>[16]</a>, 
         <a>[17]</a>. It has been hypothesized that extensive mouse brain or cell culture passage could
         lead the deletion of the potential glycosylation site 
         <a>[27]</a>. Therefore, it is important to note that several of the strains in our analyses had
         previously undergone mouse brain passages (MR 766, IbH 30656, and P6-740) (
         <a>Table 2</a>). Of these strains, two different sequences of the MR 766 strain(s) AY632535 and
         DQ859059 
         <a>[16]</a>, 
         <a>[22]</a>, and the IbH 30656 strain sequenced in this study had a deletion in the potential
         N-linked glycoslyation site. The high passage MR 766 strain that we sequenced, did
         not exhibit this deletion. These results provide strong evidence that passage history
         has influenced glycoslyation sites in the MR766 strain. Since all of the MR766 strains
         have undergone passage in mouse brains it is impossible to determine if the deletion
         was present in the original strain, as is also the case for the IbH 30656 strain.
         Further sequencing of geographically distinct, low passage strains that have not undergone
         mouse brain passage is needed to ultimately resolve whether this glycoslyation site
         polymorphism occurs in circulating strains or if it only reflects passage history.
