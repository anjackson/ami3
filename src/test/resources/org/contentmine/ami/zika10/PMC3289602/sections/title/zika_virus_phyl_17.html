      <div>Zika virus phylogeny.</div>
      <p>Nucleotide (top) and amino acid (bottom) sequences of the envelope protein/gene of
         Zika virus strains showing the deletions in the potential glycosylation sites of the
         MR 766 (Uganda, 1947) and the IbH 30656 (Nigeria, 1968) strains. Deletions are indicated
         by dashes. The “N” at position 467 of the P6-740 strain (Malaysia, 1966) represents
         an equally weighted double population of the nucleotides “C” and “T”. This translates
         to an “X” at position 165 of the amino acid alignment.
