  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0001477-g002" href="#pntd-0001477-g002">Figure 2</a>). A 4-codon deletion was observed beginning at amino acid position 153 of the E protein of the MR766 strain (GenBank accession number AY632535), a 6-codon deletion at position 156 of another MR 766 strain (GenBank accession number DQ859059), and a 6-codon deletion at position 156 of the IbH 30656 strain sequenced in this study. The MR 766 strain (Passage 147) sequenced here did not exhibit any deletions in the predicted amino acid sequence and provided evidence of passage-associated changes in potential glycosylation site(s).

   <p>Nucleotide (top) and amino acid (bottom) sequences of the envelope protein/gene of Zika virus strains showing the deletions in the potential glycosylation sites of the MR 766 (Uganda, 1947) and the IbH 30656 (Nigeria, 1968) strains. Deletions are indicated by dashes. The “N” at position 467 of the P6-740 strain (Malaysia, 1966) represents an equally weighted double population of the nucleotides “C” and “T”. This translates to an “X” at position 165 of the amino acid alignment.</p>
