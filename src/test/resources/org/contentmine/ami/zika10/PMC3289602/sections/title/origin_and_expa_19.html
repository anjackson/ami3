      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to this study, only two ZIKV strains had been genetically characterized 
         <a>[16]</a>, 
         <a>[17]</a>, 
         <a>[22]</a>. Our phylogentic analyses with the inclusion of five newly sequenced strains revealed
         the existence of two major ZIKV lineages. Analyses showed the basal divergence of
         the African and Asian lineages. Furthermore, results of the present study show that
         the FSS13025 (Cambodia, 2010), P6-740 (Malaysia, 1966) and EC Yap (Micronesia, 2007)
         strains belong to the Asian lineage, suggesting a recent common ancestor.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The clinical similarity of ZIKV infection to classical DEN fever and CHIK fever may
         be one reason why this disease has rarely been reported in Asia. During World War
         II, for example, DEN fever was a major medical problem among Allied and Japanese troops
         in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific 
         <a>[23]</a>. At that time, there were no specific laboratory tests that could differentiate between
         the three diseases. In fact, CHIKV and ZIKV still had not been isolated. Consequently,
         cases of acute febrile illness were likely diagnosed clinically as DEN or possibly
         as scrub typhus or malaria, diseases that were known and frequently diagnosed among
         the many foreign military and civilian personnel present in the region at that time
         
         <a>[23]</a>. Carey has reviewed the historical confusion in differentiating DEN fever from CHIK
         fever 
         <a>[24]</a>; but ZIKV infections have probably been misdiagnosed or not reported for some of
         the same reasons. Given the low level of nucleotide divergence among the ZIKV isolates
         here (â‰¤11.7%), conserved regions could be utilized for the development of diagnostic
         assays that will not only aid in detecting new ZIKV infections but to also differentiate
         them from other arbovirus infections.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results strengthen previous epidemiologic evidence that the EC Yap strain originated
         in Southeast Asia 
         <a>[9]</a>, 
         <a>[17]</a>. This conclusion is further substantiated by the geographic proximity of Yap Island
         to known areas of ZIKV transmission (Indonesia and Malaysia). It has been reported
         that wind-blown mosquitoes can travel distances of several hundred kilometers over
         the open ocean 
         <a>[25]</a>, 
         <a>[26]</a>. However, due to the great distances involved, it seems likely that the virus was
         introduced as a result of travel or trade activities whereby either a viremic person,
         enzootic host species, and/or an infected and subsequently infective mosquito (adult
         or immature) was transported to the island as suggested by Duffey 
         <span>et al.</span><a>[9]</a>. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that no monkeys were present on
         Yap Island during the 2007 epidemic 
         <a>[9]</a>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The phylogenetic results indicate that the Cambodian strain diverged from the Malaysian
         strain in the recent past. Therefore, the most recent common ancestor of the Cambodian
         strain has been circulating in Southeast Asia since at least the mid-1900's. These
         data indicate that Cambodian strain was either recently introduced or that it has
         been circulating in the region and has remained undetected until 2010. Seroprevalence
         surveys might help to determine when ZIKV was introduced into Cambodia.
