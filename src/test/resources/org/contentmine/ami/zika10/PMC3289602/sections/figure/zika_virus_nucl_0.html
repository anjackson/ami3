         <div>Zika virus nucleotide and amino acid alignments.</div>
         <p>Neighbor-joining phylogeny generated from open reading frame nucleotide sequences
            of Zika virus strains. The tree was rooted with Spondweni virus (GenBank accession
            number DQ859064). The scale at the bottom of the tree represents genetic distance
            in nucleotide substitutions per site. Numbers at the nodes represent percent bootstrap
            support values based on 1,000 replicates. Isolates are represented according to strain
            name, country of origin, and year of isolation. The lineage of each virus is indicated
            to the right of the tree. *Strains sequenced in this study.
