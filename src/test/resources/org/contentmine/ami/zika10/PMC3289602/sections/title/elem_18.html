         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to this study, only two ZIKV strains had been genetically characterized 
            <a>[16]</a>, 
            <a>[17]</a>, 
            <a>[22]</a>. Our phylogentic analyses with the inclusion of five newly sequenced strains revealed
            the existence of two major ZIKV lineages. Analyses showed the basal divergence of
            the African and Asian lineages. Furthermore, results of the present study show that
            the FSS13025 (Cambodia, 2010), P6-740 (Malaysia, 1966) and EC Yap (Micronesia, 2007)
            strains belong to the Asian lineage, suggesting a recent common ancestor.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The clinical similarity of ZIKV infection to classical DEN fever and CHIK fever may
            be one reason why this disease has rarely been reported in Asia. During World War
            II, for example, DEN fever was a major medical problem among Allied and Japanese troops
            in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific 
            <a>[23]</a>. At that time, there were no specific laboratory tests that could differentiate between
            the three diseases. In fact, CHIKV and ZIKV still had not been isolated. Consequently,
            cases of acute febrile illness were likely diagnosed clinically as DEN or possibly
            as scrub typhus or malaria, diseases that were known and frequently diagnosed among
            the many foreign military and civilian personnel present in the region at that time
            
            <a>[23]</a>. Carey has reviewed the historical confusion in differentiating DEN fever from CHIK
            fever 
            <a>[24]</a>; but ZIKV infections have probably been misdiagnosed or not reported for some of
            the same reasons. Given the low level of nucleotide divergence among the ZIKV isolates
            here (≤11.7%), conserved regions could be utilized for the development of diagnostic
            assays that will not only aid in detecting new ZIKV infections but to also differentiate
            them from other arbovirus infections.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results strengthen previous epidemiologic evidence that the EC Yap strain originated
            in Southeast Asia 
            <a>[9]</a>, 
            <a>[17]</a>. This conclusion is further substantiated by the geographic proximity of Yap Island
            to known areas of ZIKV transmission (Indonesia and Malaysia). It has been reported
            that wind-blown mosquitoes can travel distances of several hundred kilometers over
            the open ocean 
            <a>[25]</a>, 
            <a>[26]</a>. However, due to the great distances involved, it seems likely that the virus was
            introduced as a result of travel or trade activities whereby either a viremic person,
            enzootic host species, and/or an infected and subsequently infective mosquito (adult
            or immature) was transported to the island as suggested by Duffey 
            <span>et al.</span><a>[9]</a>. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that no monkeys were present on
            Yap Island during the 2007 epidemic 
            <a>[9]</a>.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The phylogenetic results indicate that the Cambodian strain diverged from the Malaysian
            strain in the recent past. Therefore, the most recent common ancestor of the Cambodian
            strain has been circulating in Southeast Asia since at least the mid-1900's. These
            data indicate that Cambodian strain was either recently introduced or that it has
            been circulating in the region and has remained undetected until 2010. Seroprevalence
            surveys might help to determine when ZIKV was introduced into Cambodia.

         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Glycosylation sites</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several of the ZIKV strains we analyzed exhibited the deletion of a potential N-linked
            glycosylation site that has been previously described in some ZIKV and West Nile virus
            strains 
            <a>[16]</a>, 
            <a>[17]</a>. It has been hypothesized that extensive mouse brain or cell culture passage could
            lead the deletion of the potential glycosylation site 
            <a>[27]</a>. Therefore, it is important to note that several of the strains in our analyses had
            previously undergone mouse brain passages (MR 766, IbH 30656, and P6-740) (
            <a>Table 2</a>). Of these strains, two different sequences of the MR 766 strain(s) AY632535 and
            DQ859059 
            <a>[16]</a>, 
            <a>[22]</a>, and the IbH 30656 strain sequenced in this study had a deletion in the potential
            N-linked glycoslyation site. The high passage MR 766 strain that we sequenced, did
            not exhibit this deletion. These results provide strong evidence that passage history
            has influenced glycoslyation sites in the MR766 strain. Since all of the MR766 strains
            have undergone passage in mouse brains it is impossible to determine if the deletion
            was present in the original strain, as is also the case for the IbH 30656 strain.
            Further sequencing of geographically distinct, low passage strains that have not undergone
            mouse brain passage is needed to ultimately resolve whether this glycoslyation site
            polymorphism occurs in circulating strains or if it only reflects passage history.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We had access to only a small number of ZIKV strains. However, these strains were
            broadly distributed over time and space, and the phylogenetic analyses were robust.
            Several of the ZIKV strains had been passaged intracranially in mice, and included
            two highly passaged strains, IbH 30656 (Nigeria, 1968, passage history: suckling mouse
            21, Vero 1) and MR 766 (Uganda, 1947, passage history: suckling mouse 146, C6/36 #
            1). It is likely that nucleotide/amino acid changes may have resulted from the passage
            history of the IbH 30656 strain, which may have slightly influenced the corresponding,
            terminal branch lengths in our tree but not its overall topology.

         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Summary</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This investigation indicates that the Yap Island epidemic, which occurred in the Federated
            States of Micronesia in 2007, most likely resulted from the introduction of a Southeast
            Asian ZIKV strain(s) pointing to an expansion of the Asian ZIKV lineage. Although
            ZIKV has one of the earliest and best-documented widespread geographic distributions
            among arboviruses, many unanswered questions remain concerning its evolution, ecology
            and epidemiology. In Asia, evidence suggests that the primary mosquito vectors are
            
            <span>Ae. aegypti</span> and/or 
            <span>Ae. albopictus</span><a>[13]</a>, 
            <a>[28]</a>, though several ecologically or geographically distinct mosquito vectors may be responsible
            for the transmission and/or maintenance of ZIKV throughout Asia. As such, further
            studies are needed to determine the primary and secondary mosquito vectors responsible
            for ZIKV transmission throughout the Asian region. In addition, human seroprevalence
            studies throughout Asia may provide insight into the expansion of the Asian lineage
            and clues as to why certain geographical regions maybe more suitable for virus maintenance
            and transmission than others. Additional work is needed to better understand the clinical
            presentation, tropism and pathogenesis of ZIKV infection in humans. Finally, continued
            ZIKV isolations in currently affected regions coupled with active surveillance in
            presently naïve areas will allow researchers to follow the possible geographic expansion
            of the virus and predict the potential emergence of ZIKV into uncharted territories.
