      <p>Infections with vector-borne pathogens are a major source of emerging diseases. The
         ability of vectors to bridge spatial and ecologic gaps between animals and humans
         increases opportunities for emergence. Small adaptations of a pathogen to a vector
         can have profound effects on the rate of transmission to humans.
