    "Haemoglobins are found ubiquitously in eukaryotes and many bacteria. In plants, haemoglobins were first identified in species, which can fix nitrogen via symbiosis with bacteria. Recent findings suggest that another class of haemoglobins termed as nonsymbiotic haemoglobins are present through out the plant kingdom and are expressed differentially during plant development. Limited data available suggests that non-symbiotic haemoglobins are involved in hypoxic stress and oversupply of nutrients. Due to lack of information on structurally conserved, functionally important residues in non-symbiotic haemoglobins, further studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological role are hampered. To determine functionally important residues in non-symbiotic haemoglobins, I have analyzed a number of sequences from plant haemoglobin family, in the context of the known crystal structures of plant by evolutionary trace method. Results indicate that the, evolutionary trace method like conventional phylogentic analysis, could resolve phylogentic relationships between plant haemoglobin family. Evolutionary trace analysis has identified candidate functional (trace) residues that uniquely characterize the heme-binding pocket, dimer interface and possible novel functional surfaces. Such residues from specific three-dimensional clusters might be of functional importance in nonsymbiotic haemoglobins. These data, together with our improved knowledge of possible functional residues, can be used in future structure-function analysis experiments."
