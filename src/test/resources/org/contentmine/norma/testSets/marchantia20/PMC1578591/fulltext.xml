Gene families appear to evolve through a combination of tandem, segmental and whole genome duplication (polyploidy) events. A number of researchers in the first half of the twentieth century observed relationships between chromosome duplications and morphological variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In 1970, Ohno [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] argued that, because natural selection is inherently conservative, major genetic novelty can arise only through gene duplication events where purifying selection is relaxed on one of the duplicates. The classical model of the fates of duplicate genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] predicts that most gene duplicates are lost due to deleterious mutations and that new function arises only with rare beneficial mutations resulting from neutral processes.</p><p>More recent theoretical and empirical work suggests that gene duplicates are retained more frequently than the classical model permits and that new function or expression arises through the processes of neo- and subfunctionalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In subfunctionalization, expression or function present in a progenitor gene is partitioned between daughter genes through complementary mutations to regulatory or coding regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In neofunctionalization, related or novel function may arise in one of the duplicates through initial relaxation of purifying selection with accumulation of mutations conferring new function under either neutral or positive selection. Partitioning of expression appears to be the most common fate of a fixed gene duplicate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and it appears to happen relatively rapidly after duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, many gene duplicate pairs appear to evolve slowly, suggesting that buffering of crucial functions may be important after gene duplication events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Plant genomes contain large fractions of duplicate loci due to the frequent occurrence of segmental duplications and polyploidy events. Following a polyploidy event, there is a rapid loss of duplicate loci in the transition to functional diploidy and the remaining duplicate loci undergo rapid functional divergence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Recent genome-scale studies indicate that some types of duplicate genes are retained at higher frequencies than others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], that highly conserved genes are duplicated and retained more frequently than more rapidly evolving genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and that rates of protein evolution may be related to expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and patterns, with genes expressed in multiple tissues under stronger purifying selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we investigate the monosaccharide transporter (MST) gene family in land plants. MSTs are found in all three domains of life, have fundamental importance in carbohydrate flux and are highly conserved across lineages. All MST proteins are characterized by 12 hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains separated by interconnecting cytoplasmic and extracellular loops, with cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This highly conserved protein structure provides a strong signature for identification of putative MSTs in translated DNA sequence data, such as ESTs. Most plant MST genes characterized to date show expression in sink tissues and are thought to function in the uptake of simple sugars from the apoplast after phloem-unloading and hydrolysis of sucrose by co-expressed cell wall invertases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Most have been shown to be H<sup>+</sup>-sugar symporters localized in the plasma membrane (see references below).</p><p>Previous analysis of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>genome reveals 53 MST genes that cluster into seven subfamilies on phylogenetic analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. To date, less than a dozen of these 53 genes have been characterized as to function and/or expression. The STP subfamily is the best studied, with published reports on seven of the 14 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Only a handful of genes in the other subfamilies, <italic>AtERD6 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], <italic>AtSFP1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], <italic>AtpGlcT </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], <italic>AtPLT5 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and <italic>AtINT4 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] have been studied. However, a number of MSTs in green algae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and other higher plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] have been investigated, contributing to our understanding of the functional diversity of this gene family in the green plants as a whole. Because some of these proteins have been documented to transport sugar alcohols, this gene family is named the MST(-like) gene family on the TAIR website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. For simplicity, we will refer to all genes in the MST(-like) family as MST genes.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Maximum likelihood phylogeny of Arabidopsis MSTproteins</bold>.

As such, it presents an opportunity to study gene family evolution in major lineages that differ greatly in structural complexity and life histories. Land plants consist broadly of primitive nonvascular and more complex vascular plants. The small, structurally simple nonvascular plants are composed of three major groups, the liverworts, mosses, and hornworts, collectively known as "the bryophytes." In bryophytes, the small diploid sporophyte is epiphytic on the dominant, leafy haploid gametophyte. Lycophytes are the earliest divergent vascular plants represented today by only a few extant lineages, the club mosses (Lycopodiaceae), spike mosses (Selaginellaceae), and quillworts (Isoetaceae). The pteridophytes are composed of three lineages of ferns (Ophioglossaceae, Marattiales, and Polypodiales), the horsetails (<italic>Equisetum</italic>) and whisk ferns (Psilotaceae) that form a monophyletic group which is sister to the seed plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Seed plants are composed of four groups of gymnosperms (conifers, cycads, ginkgos and gnetophytes) and the angiosperms (flowering plants). All land plants exhibit alternation of generations, the formation of a multicellular body in both the haploid and diploid phase of the life cycle. However, in contrast to the non-vascular bryophytes, all vascular plant lineages are characterized by life histories in which the diploid sporophyte is dominant and the haploid gametophyte is much reduced in size. In the seed plants (especially the flowering plants), the gametophytes are most reduced in size and nutritionally dependent upon the sporophyte.</p><p>Because the common ancestor of land plants is inferred to have had a haploid-dominant life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], hypotheses regarding gene expression in the simple gametophyte versus the complex sporophyte have focused around the idea that sporophyte genes were 'recruited' from the haploid gametophyte genome in the early evolution of land plants, resulting in overlapping expression of identical genes in both generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Hypotheses that integrate the potentially significant role of gene duplication and divergence in the early evolution of the complex sporophyte have begun to be developed and tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The study of specific gene families in the earliest land plant lineages with dominant or independent gametophytes may help to answer these questions.</p><p>Analyzing a complete genome sequence is the only method whereby all members of a gene family can be identified with certainty. At the time of this study, complete plant genome sequences are available for <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>and <italic>Oryza sativa </italic>(rice). However, large EST databases (&#x0003e;100,000 ESTs) derived from multiple tissues, developmental stages and experimental conditions represent a resource for studying the genomes of species with unsequenced genomes through their transcriptomes. Large EST databases are available for many important crop plants across the monocot and eudicot flowering plants. However, only two large EST databases are available for earlier divergent land plants: the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and the gymnosperm <italic>Pinus taeda </italic>(loblolly pine) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Small EST databases exist for several species belonging to other major early land plant lineages including a liverwort, <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic>, a lycophyte, <italic>Selaginella lepidophylla</italic>, and the fern <italic>Ceratopteris richardii</italic>. Each of these small databases is derived from limited tissue types, the <italic>Marchantia </italic>library constructed from sex organ tissues (gametophyte), the <italic>Selaginella </italic>database from dessicated frond (sporophyte), and the <italic>Ceratopteris </italic>library from germinating spores (gametophyte). We searched the large EST databases of <italic>Zea mays </italic>(corn), <italic>Lycopersicon esculentum </italic>(tomato), <italic>Pinus taeda</italic>, <italic>Physcomitrella patens </italic>and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. We also searched the small <italic>Marchantia</italic>, <italic>Selaginella </italic>and <italic>Ceratopteris </italic>EST databases described above.</p><p>To search these databases, we constructed profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) of each MST subfamily. Profile HMMs are probabilistic models representing an alignment of multiple amino acid sequences that are very effective at identifying related sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. To build a profile HMM of a particular protein family, a multiple sequence alignment containing sequences from as diverse an assembly of species as possible is created in order to properly represent both the conserved and divergent regions across the protein family. The resulting profile HMMs (or consensus protein sequences created from them) can be used to search EST databases with software such as the Wise2 package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>Given that MSTs are ubiquitous across all three domains of life and that homologs of each of the seven <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>subfamilies have been found in many vascular plant species as well as the green alga <italic>Chlorella kessleri</italic>, we hypothesize that the seven subfamilies of MST genes identified in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>are ancient, with ancestral homologs of each subfamily likely present in the earliest land plants. Second, given the prevalence of individual gene, segmental chromosome and whole genome duplications within the land plants, the MST subfamilies are likely to have unique expansion patterns within lineages. Third, if partitioning of expression is the most prevalent fate of duplicate genes, then we would expect to find unique patterns of MST gene expression across lineages. Last, if broadly expressed genes are more conserved than narrowly expressed genes, then <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genes with broad expression should be most similar to orthologs in the earliest lineages. We infer breadth of expression of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>MST genes based on their relative representation, within subfamily, in the combined EST database along with an evaluation of microarray data.</p><p>To investigate these questions, our study consisted of the following analyses: (1) construction of a statistically robust phylogenetic tree of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>MST proteins; (2) mapping of each <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>MST gene to determine segmental and tandem gene duplications; (3) construction of profile HMMs and consensus protein sequences for each MST subfamily; (4) a search of the large <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>EST database to determine relative representation of each MST gene (and to provide a comparison for evaluating the effectiveness of our profile HMMs at identifying ESTs in other species); (5) a search of EST databases of other major land plant lineages (described above) for ESTs belonging to each MST subfamily; (6) creation of EST contigs to infer the number of expressed MST loci present in each large EST database; and (7) correlation of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>MST genes with high EST database representation with best match homologs in early divergent lineages.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Phylogenetic analysis and mapping of the MST gene family in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic></title><p>Phylogenetic analysis of the 53 <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>MST protein sequences using the maximum likelihood (ML) method (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) revealed a phylogeny in agreement with the phylogeny posted on the Arabidopsis Sugar Transporter homepage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], with one notable exception: In our ML tree, the <italic>AtSTP13 </italic>protein clusters at the base of the subclade containing the <italic>AtSTP2</italic>, <italic>-6 </italic>and <italic>-8 </italic>genes, rather than grouping with the <italic>AtSTP14 </italic>and <italic>AtSTP7 </italic>genes. The bootstrap value for this arrangement is quite low at 36, indicating an unresolved node. However, mapping the STP genes on the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>) supports a close relationship between <italic>AtSTP6 </italic>and <italic>AtSTP13 </italic>as a result of a segmental duplication event involving these two genes. Across the tree, most bootstrap values were 90 or higher, with all seven nodes at the base of each subfamily clade having bootstrap values of 100. A consensus maximum parsimony (MP) tree of all 53 MST protein sequences with 10,000 bootstrap replicates revealed a topology that was essentially the same as the ML topology with similar support values among most genes (not shown). Nodes with low bootstrap support values on the ML tree are represented by polytomies on the MP tree. In our MP tree, the <italic>AtSTP13 </italic>gene forms a polytomy with four other STP gene groups, including the <italic>AtSTP7</italic>-<italic>14 </italic>and <italic>AtSTP2</italic>-<italic>6</italic>-<italic>8 </italic>groups. The chromosome map of all 53 MST genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>) reveals six regions of tandem gene duplications, four of which involve ERD6-like genes. Segmental duplications are present in all subfamilies except the pGlcT subfamily.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of profile hidden Markov models and consensus sequences</title><p>We searched the Protein Families (pfam) database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] for all full-length or nearly full-length non-<italic>Arabidopsis </italic>MST genes within the viridiplantae clade.

Because polyols are known osmoprotectants in stress conditions and many bryophytes are known to leach sugars and polyols after freeze-thaw events in cold temperature environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], it seems likely that bryophytes possess polyol transporters. <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>, specifically, has been shown to be drought, salt and freezing-tolerant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. The largest <italic>Physcomitrella </italic>EST database searched (120,702 ESTs) was constructed from auxin and cytokinin-treated gametophytes and gametophytes with no hormone treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Abscisic acid (ABA) is known to induce stress-related genes in plants. However, of the remaining <italic>Physcomitrella </italic>ESTs searched (19,914 ESTs), only 2,492 ESTs were derived from ABA-treated gametophytes (1.8% of total ESTs in the clustered <italic>Physcomitrella </italic>EST database). It may be that expression of PLT genes in <italic>Physcomitrella patens </italic>is induced by stress and that stress-induced genes are significantly underrepresented in the clustered <italic>Physcomitrella </italic>EST database, resulting in the absence of many stress-induced genes in the database. However, absence of this subfamily of transporters in this species may also be real. The earliest divergent lineage in which we found ESTs from the PLT subfamily is the fern lineage <italic>(Ceratopteris richardii)</italic>, which diverged from its common ancestor with the seed plants approximately 400 million years ago. We found no expressed PLT genes in the EST database of the lycophyte <italic>Selaginella lepidophylla</italic>, but absence of this subfamily from this EST database may be an artifact of its small size (1,046 ESTs).</p></sec><sec><title>MST gene family size varies across lineages</title><p>The total number of expressed MST loci in each species varied from 18 to 64 in the five lineages with large EST databases. Not surprisingly, the smallest number of expressed MST loci (18) was found in the early divergent moss, <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>. The largest number of expressed MST loci (64) was found in the gymnosperm <italic>Pinus taeda</italic>, with the angiosperms <italic>Zea mays </italic>and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>having similar numbers of expressed MST loci (46 and 44 respectively). Interestingly, the number of expressed MST loci in the <italic>Lycopersicon esculentum </italic>EST database, at 24, is almost half as large as the number of expressed loci in the <italic>Zea </italic>and <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>databases, and not much larger than the number of loci expressed in the nonvascular moss. Possible explanations include a significant bias in the <italic>Lycopersicon </italic>database or a paucity of large and/or small-scale gene duplication events in the <italic>Lycopersicon </italic>lineage, resulting in small gene family sizes compared to lineages in which gene duplication events have been more numerous. Given that the cDNA libraries from which the <italic>Lycopersicon </italic>ESTs were derived appear to be as varied in tissue/organ type and developmental stage as the other large EST databases analyzed, it appears likely that bias in the database does not completely explain the low numbers of expressed MSTs. Comparison of sequenced segments of the tomato genome with the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genome reveals multiple large-scale genome duplications are present in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] but not <italic>Lycopersicon</italic>, suggesting that the low numbers of expressed MST loci in tomato may be a result, at least in part, of fewer large-scale genome duplication events in its evolutionary history. A lower level of tandem gene duplication events (at least in the MST gene family) may also be a factor in the low number of expressed MST loci.</p></sec><sec><title>MST subfamily expression levels differ across lineages</title><p>The relative expression level of most subfamilies, inferred from these EST data, appears to have changed across the major land plant lineages, with the AZT and pGlcT gene subfamilies having much greater proportional expression in the early moss lineage (37.5% each for AZT and pGlcT) than in the gymnosperm (2.6% and 21.1%), monocot (16.3% and 13.1%) and eudicot lineages (averages of 3.4% and 7.4%) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Conversely, proportional expression levels of the STP subfamily are greatly increased in the gymnosperm and angiosperm lineages (an average of 30%) as compared to the moss (9.7%). Relative expression levels of the ERD6-like subfamily also show an increase from the lowest levels in the moss (3.5%) through the gymnosperm (11.9%), monocot (19.9%) and eudicot lineages (average of 33%). It is possible that these differences in relative expression levels for each subfamily reflect bias in the cDNA libraries from which the ESTs in each database were derived. However, since each of the large databases contains large numbers of ESTs derived from whole plant tissue and major organ tissues under different conditions, it is likely that these data do reflect some real differences in relative subfamily expression. In the absence of functional characterization and expression studies for genes in each of the subfamilies, it is premature to speculate about the functional significance of these relative expression differences. However, given that monosaccharide transporters are associated with a variety of sink tissues, co-expressed cell wall invertases and phloem unloading in the vascular plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], we would predict an increase in size and complexity of this gene family. Increased expression and expansion of the STP, ERD6-like, INT and PLT subfamilies in the vascular plants, therefore, may reflect the evolution of structural and physiological complexity associated with vascularity.</p><p>In addition, the proportion of MST ESTs identified in each of the databases varied between 0.05% in <italic>Lycopersicon </italic>and 0.28% in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) with an average of 0.13%. The small EST databases showed percentages of MST ESTs ranging from 0.12&#x02013;0.19%. A potential source of differences in relative proportion of MST ESTs identified in each EST database is a bias in the sequences from which the profile HMMs were constructed. However, this seems unlikely, given that there was one gymnosperm, many monocot and two <italic>Lycopersicon </italic>MST sequences included in the profile HMM sequence set and none for the very early divergent liverwort, moss, and lycophyte lineages, but percentages of MST ESTs identified in the liverwort, moss and lycophyte databases are higher (0.10&#x02013;0.19%) than in <italic>Lycopersicon </italic>and <italic>Zea</italic>. It seems noteworthy that the percentage of MST ESTs in the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>database is substantially higher (0.28%) than in any of the other species (0.05&#x02013;0.19%).</p></sec><sec><title>MST gene expression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic></title><p>In this large database of 415,250 ESTs, derived from multiple plant stages, tissue types and treatments, we found ESTs representing 44 of the 53 known MST genes (83%). Of the nine genes for which we found no ESTs, the function and expression of three are known. Interestingly, these three genes (<italic>AtSTP2</italic>, <italic>-6</italic>, and <italic>-9</italic>) are expressed in developing pollen only (the haploid male gametophyte). One other gene known to be expressed in pollen only is <italic>AtSTP11</italic>, for which we found one EST derived from a mixture of silique and flower tissue. Absence of the <italic>AtSTP2</italic>, <italic>-6 </italic>and <italic>-9 </italic>genes from the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>EST database, then, seems likely due to the paucity of transcripts from pollen development in the database. This invites speculation that some or all of the six other genes missing from the database may also be expressed in gametophyte tissue only. An evaluation of microarray gene expression data contained on the Weigel World website (AtGenExpress Development) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] reveals that of the six remaining missing MST genes, three have expression profiles consistent with pollen-specific expression (<italic>AtSTP10</italic>, <italic>AtPLT1</italic>, and <italic>AttMT3</italic>), with one gene not present on the array (<italic>AtPLT2</italic>). An examination of the adaptive significance of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>MST gene expression in relation to rates of sequence evolution is currently underway in our laboratory (data unpublished).</p><p>Overall patterns of individual MST gene EST database representation in some subfamilies reveal that one, or a few, genes have significantly greater representation than the others. For example, in the STP subfamily, <italic>AtSTP1 </italic>(74.8%), <italic>AtSTP13 </italic>(10.7%) and <italic>AtSTP4 </italic>(7.9%) make up 93.4% of 10 represented STP genes. In the PLT subfamily, the <italic>AtPLT5 </italic>gene makes up 87.2% of total subfamily representation. In the greatly expanded ERD6-like subfamily, however, gene representation is apportioned more equitably with most genes ranging between 3% and 10% of the total EST database representation. The ERD6-like gene with the highest representation (18.6%) is <italic>AtSFP1</italic>. The large expansion of this subfamily is due to tandem duplications involving four clusters of genes, with no other <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>MST subfamily showing this high level of tandem duplication. Most of the highly represented ERD6-like genes are members of these tandem arrays.</p><p>High representation of a specific gene in the combined <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>EST database may be the result of high expression (transcript levels) in one or more organs or lower expression in many different organs (broad expression). However, many cDNA libraries from which ESTs are derived are normalized, eliminating redundant transcripts of genes with high or broad expression and increasing the relative proportion of transcripts from genes with low or narrow expression. Thus, there may be genes with relatively low representation in the EST database that are, in fact, more broadly or highly expressed than indicated by their relative presence in the database.</p></sec><sec><title>The MST subfamilies have lineage-specific expansion patterns</title><p>Our data present clear evidence that the MST subfamilies have experienced lineage-specific expansions across the land plant family tree (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). In the earliest lineage with a large EST database, <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>, each subfamily is comparatively small (between one and five expressed loci) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) relative to the gymnosperm and angiosperm lineages. Its two largest subfamilies, AZT and pGlcT, each have five expressed loci. In the AZT subfamily, four loci appear to be the result of repeated duplications arising in the ancestral <italic>AttMT2 </italic>gene lineage. In the pGlcT subfamily, three loci appear to be the result of duplications arising in the ancestral <italic>AtpGlcT </italic>gene lineage. The gymnosperm <italic>Pinus taeda </italic>has four expanded subfamilies, STP, ERD6-like, INT, and PLT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Almost half of the STP subfamily expansion in <italic>Pinus taeda </italic>is the result of ten duplications in the ancestral <italic>AtSTP7 </italic>gene lineage. In the INT subfamily, eight duplications in the ancestral <italic>AtINT2 </italic>gene lineage and four gene duplications in the ancestral <italic>AtINT1 </italic>gene lineage result in 86% of expressed loci. The monocot angiosperm <italic>Zea mays </italic>has three expanded subfamilies, STP, ERD6-like and PLT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In the STP subfamily, two ancestral genes orthologous to <italic>AtSTP5 </italic>and <italic>AtSTP1 </italic>each experienced four gene duplications, resulting in more than half of the <italic>Zea mays </italic>STP genes. The eudicot angiosperm <italic>Lycopersicon esculentum </italic>has two slightly expanded subfamilies, STP and ERD6-like, but there are no instances where more than two expressed loci appear to have been duplicated from one ancestral gene lineage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>the STP and ERD6-like subfamilies are large. Mapping of duplication events on the phylogeny (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) reveals three segmental duplications and one tandem duplication discernible in the STP subfamily. Two segmental duplications (one involving two genes) and six apparent tandem duplications have resulted in the large expansion of the ERD6-like subfamily. Differences in subfamily size among the monocot and dicot rosid and asterid lineages are likely correlated to the number of whole genome duplication events in their evolutionary histories (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). A recent analysis of EST data and completed genome sequence for 14 model plant species has inferred three polyploidy events in the monocot lineage, three in the dicot rosid lineage but only two in the dicot asterid lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).

In addition, a study in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and another in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] present strong evidence that genes with broad expression are under stronger purifying selection than genes with tissue-specific expression. Two models have been proposed to explain this: (1) A protein with broad expression would be exposed to more diverse biochemical environments and, hence, would be under stronger purifying selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. (2) A broadly expressed protein with a deleterious mutation would most likely have a greater impact on organismal fitness than a protein with narrow, tissue-specific expression and would, thus, experience greater purifying selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>We performed a simple analysis of the relationship between <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>MST genes with relatively high EST database representation within subfamily and the presence of best match MST homologs in early lineages to explore patterns that might be consistent with these studies. We assumed that, because the combined <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>EST database is derived from many different tissues, developmental stages and growth conditions, an <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>gene with high representation in the database, relative to other members of its subfamily, is likely a gene with high and/or broad expression, and a gene with low representation is likely a gene with low and/or narrow expression. We evaluated this assumption with an analysis of the AtGenExpress <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>developmental microarray gene expression data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. An expressed gene in an early divergent lineage with a best match to an <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>gene was used an as indication that the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>gene is evolving relatively slowly under strong purifying selection.</p><p>Of 13 MST genes with relatively high subfamily representation, 11 have best match homologs in one or more of the five early divergent land plants included in our study (liverwort, moss, lycophyte, fern, or gymnosperm) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). Of these, the expression of three (<italic>AtSTP1</italic>, <italic>AtSTP4</italic>, and <italic>AtPLT5</italic>) has been characterized and can be considered broad, i.e., expressed in multiple organs and developmental stages. <italic>AtSTP1 </italic>is expressed in germinating seeds and seedlings, concentrated in the root, and also in guard cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. <italic>STP4 </italic>is expressed in classic sink tissues such as root tips, pollen and anthers and in tissues damaged by environmental stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. <italic>PLT5 </italic>is expressed most strongly in roots but also in vascular tissue of leaves and in floral organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Microarray expression profiles from the developmental AtGenExpress dataset reveal that all of the MST genes we identified with high representation in the EST database (with the exception of At3g51490 which is not present on the array) have profiles consistent with broad expression across three or more major plant structures (root, stem, leaf, flower, and/or seed). The two ERD6-like subfamily genes with high EST database representation that lack the presence of orthologs in early lineages also have microarray profiles consistent with broad expression. These two genes are both members of a large subclade of tandemly duplicated genes in the ERD6-like subfamily and may have undergone substantial divergence from an ancestral gene present in an early lineage. Of the five MST genes with relatively low, or no, representation in the database and best match homologs in early lineages, three (<italic>AtSTP7</italic>, <italic>At5g18840</italic>, and <italic>AtINT2</italic>) have microarray expression profiles consistent with broad expression and two (<italic>At3g51490 </italic>and <italic>AtPLT4</italic>) appear to have limited expression, including expression in pollen. The broadly expressed genes may have low EST database representation as a result of normalized cDNA libraries and/or because they have low expression levels (making our analysis of the correlation between high EST database representation and the presence of orthologs in early lineages conservative). The genes expressed in pollen may be conserved descendants of ancestral MST genes present in the earliest land plants, and thus have orthologs present in the extant members of these early lineages.</p><fig position="float" id="F10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p><bold>Correlation between high EST database representation of Arabidopsis MST genes and the presence of best match orthologs in one or more early land plant lineages</bold>.

However, if gene duplication events are prevalent in plants and the most common fate of retained gene duplicates is a partitioning of gene expression, a large number of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genes that show similarity to genes expressed in the <italic>Physcomitrella </italic>gametophyte are likely to be paralogs, and not direct descendants of the same genes expressed in the gametophyte of a common ancestor. A recent genome-scale comparison of the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>male gametophyte (pollen) transcriptome with the sporophyte transcriptome revealed a 61% overlap in expression of 992 pollen-expressed mRNAs, with nearly 40% of these showing pollen-specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Our analysis of MST gene transcripts represented in the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>EST database and the AtGenExpress microarray expression data suggests that at least seven of the 43 MSTs may be gametophyte-specific.</p><p>Our comparison of MST genes in the transcriptomes of <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>, <italic>Pinus taeda</italic>, <italic>Zea mays </italic>and <italic>Lycopersicon esculentum </italic>with the known MST gene family in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>also allowed us to identify significant differences in size between the STP and ERD6-like subfamilies in the nonvascular moss lineage and the vascular gymnosperm and angiosperm lineages, suggesting that expansion of these subfamilies is potentially related to the evolution of the vascular sporophyte. Hypotheses about the origin and evolution of the complex vascular sporophyte must include explicit ideas about the role of gene duplication and divergence in the expression of genes in the separate haploid and diploid phases of the plant life cycle. The significance of MST gene duplication on plant life cycle evolution remains to be revealed through appropriate empirical studies.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The subfamilies of MST genes present in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>are ancient, with six of the seven subfamilies (STP, AZT, ERD6-like, pGlcT, INT and XyloseTP homologs) found in the moss lineage, which diverged from its common ancestor with the vascular plants &#x0003e;410 million years ago. Among the EST databases that we searched, the earliest lineage in which a homolog of the PLT subfamily was identified was the fern lineage, which diverged from its common ancestor with the vascular plants about 400 million years ago. The PLT subfamily may be present in earlier lineages but developmental or environmental conditions under which these transporters are expressed may not be present in the EST databases.</p><p>The MST subfamilies also show lineage-specific subfamily expansion patterns. Subfamily expansion in the vascular plants often appears to be due to multiple gene duplications arising from a single ancestral gene (likely tandem duplications) within a subfamily. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the large expansion of the ERD6-like subfamily is due to four clusters of tandem duplications involving 68% of subfamily genes.</p><p>Relative subfamily expression levels, inferred from EST data, vary across lineages. There is greater expression of the STP and ERD6-like subfamilies in the gymnosperm and flowering plant lineages, with relatively high expression of the AZT and pGlcT subfamilies in the nonvascular moss lineage. These differences may reflect increased roles of the STP and ERD6-like subfamilies in the long-distance transport of sugars in vascular plants.</p><p>EST database representation of individual <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genes indicates that one or a few genes within a subfamily often have much higher representation than others. These patterns are consistent with models of gene duplicate divergence in which a gene duplicate assumes a portion of the function and/or expression of a progenitor gene having broad function and/or expression. However, the largest <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>subfamily, the ERD6-like subfamily, does not fit this pattern, with a large number of tandem gene duplicates having more equitable EST database representation.</p><p>Correlation of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genes with high EST database representation with the presence of orthologs in early lineages reveals that 11 of 13 highly represented genes (85%) have best match homologs. This is consistent with hypotheses that genes with high and/or broad expression are more conserved than genes with narrow expression. Of the five <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genes with little or no representation in the database that also had best match homologs in early lineages, three had microarray expression profiles consistent with broad expression and two had more narrow expression patterns, including expression in pollen (male gametophyte). These genes expressed in the haploid phase may be conserved descendants of ancestral genes expressed in the dominant or independent haploid phase of early land plants and, in the absence of another allele, are likely to be under strong purifying selection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Phylogenetic analysis and gene mapping</title><p>Phylogenetic analysis of the 53 <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>MST protein sequences using maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony was performed.
