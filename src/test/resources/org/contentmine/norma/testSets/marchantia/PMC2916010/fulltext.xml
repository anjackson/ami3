Fifteen STK sequences were obtained by degenerate PCR. Sequence analysis showed that nine of them have continued open reading frames, and they are separated into five classes based on sequence analysis. Interestingly, one of the classes (STK V) showed less than 40% similarity to any other class, possibly representing new type genes from chestnut rose. Southern blotting analysis revealed that the new type STK V genes are single copy, while all the other genes have several copies in the genome.

It has recently been labeled as one of the three promising new fruit crops in China due to its fruit having high content of vitamin C (2000-3000 mg/100 g FW), displaying high levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and therefore is believed to have senescence-retarding and cancer-preventing effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Unfortunately, chestnut rose crops are suffering from powdery mildew disease. After decades of breeding, an indigenous cultivar from Guizhou province of China, Guinong No. 6, was discovered to be highly resistant to powdery mildew [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This material provides an opportunity to investigate the mechanism underlying the generation of the powdery mildew resistance specificity in chestnut rose.</p><p>Plants rely on their innate immune system to defend against pathogens. The immune system is composed of three important steps, i.e. pathogen detection, signal transduction, and defense response initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The pathogen detection protein, encoded by resistance (<italic>R</italic>) genes, can recognize pathogen-produced effectors and will produce a defense signal; the transmission and amplification of defense a signal requires kinase genes in the plant cell; finally the host initiates transcription of the defense-response gene including the pathogenesis-related (<italic>PR</italic>) gene that can confer local or systemic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Among the component genes of plant immune system, most researches are focusing on <italic>R </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Many <italic>R </italic>genes have now been cloned from a wide variety of plant species, of which the largest class is belonging to the nucleotide-binding site--leucine-rich repeats (NBS-LRR) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The NBS domain is highly conserved across plant species, this characteristic facilitated the cloning of large number of sequences homologous to R genes, and so-called "R gene candidates (RGCs)", from many plant species by degenerate PCR strategy. Comprehensive analysis of plant RGCs have revealed that several important molecular events including duplication, recombination, mutation, strong balancing selection, diversifying selection, and meiotic instability occur on plant <italic>R </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Compared with <italic>R </italic>genes, research on other component genes of the plant immune system were rather limited.</p><p>Serine/threonine protein kinase (STK) is one of the important proteins responsible for defense signal transduction. The STK domain is the major constituent of the tomato <italic>Pto </italic>gene which not only interacts with the avirulence proteins from <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic>, but also functions as a signal transduction mediator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The STK domain is also contained in the rice <italic>Xa21 </italic>gene which confers resistance to <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae </italic>pv oryzae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. STK domains are conserved across plant species, and have been isolated in several plant species by degenerate PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Genome-level analysis of kinase genes were mainly carried out in Arabidopsis and rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]; and evolutionary analysis revealed that ancient diversification and rapid evolution occur on STK genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>A great effort was taken to understand what happens to the immune system in parallel with the generation of the resistance specificity in the chestnut rose powdery mildew resistance genotype Guinong No.6 in our Lab. A total of 38 and 37 NBS-type resistance gene candidates (RGCs) were cloned from the resistant and susceptible genotype, respectively. Comparative analysis showed that the RGCs are under rapid evolution and are polymorphic between resistant and susceptible genotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Moreover, genes corresponding to the defense response including <italic>pathogenesis related 2 </italic>(<italic>PR2</italic>) and <italic>PR5 </italic>gene families were cloned; sequence polymorphisms including single nucleotide differences and small insertion/deletions (InDel) were observed in these plant immunity genes. Through analysis of these two kinds of plant immunity genes, we discovered some information on the chestnut rose immune system. However, knowledge on the defense-related kinase genes is lacking. This prompted us to clone the STK kinase genes and investigate their sequence features, genomic status, and evolutionary characteristics in the chestnut rose powdery mildew resistance genotype.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials</title><p>Guinong No.6, a powdery mildew-resistant cultivar was used for STK genes cloning.

The remained sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis. Drosiphila <italic>Pelle </italic>gene was used as outgroup in this study. Rosa 1 comprises STK1 and STK7 genes; Rosa 2 comprises STK2 and STK8 genes; Rosa3 comprises STK3 and STK4 genes; Rosa4 comprises STK5, STK6 and STK9 genes.

Most of the previous molecular studies focus on the pathogen detection <italic>R </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In this study, we characterized <italic>STK </italic>genes which encode kinase proteins responsible for the signal transduction during defense response. The genes from the relative wild fruit tree 'chestnut rose' showed close phylogenetic relationship to those from Rosaceae homologs after phylogenetic analysis of the STK genes from 21 plant species; however, some genes are a new type from chestnut rose. For example, STK3 and STK4 formed a unique clade which cannot be clustered with homolog genes from plants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This indicates that from this wild fruit tree most of the <italic>STK </italic>genes are ancient and conserved, but with few plant-specific genes.</p><sec><title>The <italic>STK </italic>genes from a wild fruit crop 'chestnut rose'</title><p>A total of 15 STK sequences were obtained from chestnut rose, of them nine have continue open reading frame. The nine genes have been separated into five classes based on both sequence similarity and phylogenetic analyses. Four of the five classes were belonging to known <italic>STK </italic>kinases, while the remained one class (STKV) represents a new type. The STK3 and STK4 genes (member of STKV class) showed less than 40% similarity to any other gene, and phylogenetic analysis showed that STKV class formed a unique clade which is more related with drosophila <italic>pelle </italic>gene than plant species <italic>STK </italic>genes. The low similarity observed among STKV class with other four STK classes is not rare case for plant immunity genes. For example, resistance (<italic>R</italic>) gene, the other component of plant immune system, sometimes showed low sequence similarities. Resistance gene candidates (RGCs) sequence similarity ranged from 27 to 50% in <italic>Zingiber </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and 19-44% in lettuce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These data suggests that <italic>STK </italic>gene, as well as <italic>R </italic>genes, may exist in the genome long history and have diversified greatly during the long history evolution.</p></sec><sec><title>Defense system in chestnut rose and its evolution</title><p>From a powdery mildew resistant genotype of chestnut rose, the component gene of immune system, i.e. <italic>R</italic>-like gene, kinase genes, <italic>PR </italic>genes, are all cloned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In this study, we observed that STK2 and STK8 genes showed a close relationship with <italic>Pto </italic>Resistance gene, possibly indicated that they are candidate genes involved in the defense system in chestnut rose. When considering with the previous studies together, we found that for each plant immunity component gene many polymorphic members exist in the chestnut rose genome. This suggests that in the chestnut rose genome there is a sufficient resource of immunity genes utilized by plants to defend against pathogen attacks. Evolutionary analysis of these immunity genes also provided some clues on the complexity of plant immune system. Diversifying selection has been detected on RGC genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]; and for <italic>PR2 </italic>genes diversifying selection is predominant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] in chestnut rose. The genes under diversifying selection are believed to have strong function in the defense, suggesting that in chestnut rose <italic>PR2 </italic>and <italic>R </italic>genes are actively involved in the immune responses which also require kinase gene for defense signaling. However, the immune system located in the plant cell is more complex than we can imagine. For example, there are more than 300 defensin-like genes in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]; many kinase genes such as Calmodulin-like domain protein kinases (CDPKs), and MAP kinases (MAPKs) were reported to be involved in defense activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Thus, plants can utilize enough strategies to defend against a pathogen invasion during the long time history.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>From a wild fruit crop 'chestnut rose', serine/threonine kinase (STK) genes were cloned by degenerate PCR. Fifteen STK sequences were isolated, and nine of them have continued to open reading frames, and they are separated into five classes based on sequence analysis. One of the classes (STK V) showed less than 40% similarity to any other new type of <italic>STK </italic>genes, and these new type STK genes exist as single copies in the genome, and they are phylogenetically related with animal homologs rather than plant homologs. The polymorphic STK genes, combined with other plant immunity genes, provide sufficient resources for the plants to defend against pathogen attacks.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>QX and XXD designed the research.
