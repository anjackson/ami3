These proteins play a key role in photosynthesis and are involved in both light harvesting and photoprotection.

Sequence identification and analysis showed that some antenna polypeptides, such as Lhcb3 and Lhcb6, are present only in land organisms, suggesting they play a role in adaptation to the sub-aerial environment. Our functional analysis which showed that photo-protective mechanisms in <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> are very similar to those in seed plants fits with this hypothesis. In particular, <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> also activates Non Photochemical Quenching upon illumination, consistent with the detection of an ortholog of the PsbS protein. As a further adaptation to terrestrial conditions, the content of Photosystem I low energy absorbing chlorophylls also increased, as demonstrated by differences in Lhca3 and Lhca4 polypeptide sequences, <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution experiments and low temperature fluorescence spectra.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study highlights the role of Lhc family members in environmental adaptation and allowed proteins associated with mechanisms of stress resistance to be identified within this large family.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Photosynthesis is powered by light absorbed by chlorophyll (Chl<sup>1</sup>) and carotenoid molecules bound to thylakoid membrane proteins. Pigment-binding proteins are organized into two supramolecular complexes: Photosystem (PS) I and II. Each Photosystem is composed of two different moieties: (i) the core complex, responsible for charge separation and the first steps of electron transport, and (ii) the peripheral antenna system, which plays a role in light harvesting and the transfer of excitation energy to the reaction center. Reaction centers are widely conserved among organisms and only small differences are found between seed plants and cyanobacteria whereas antenna systems, in contrast, are more variable <xref rid="pone.0002033-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002033-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In most prokaryotes the antenna system is based on phycobilisomes while in eukaryotes it is composed of members of a multigene family which in broad terms is represented by Chl a/b-xanthophyll binding proteins in seed plants and green algae, Carotenoid-Chl a/c proteins in chromophytes and the intrinsic peridinin-Chl a/c proteins (Lhcd) present in many dinoflagellates <xref rid="pone.0002033-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002033-Durnford1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002033-Jansson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Despite diverse pigment content, primary sequence similarities indicate that all these antenna proteins originated from a common ancestral gene with one transmembrane helix <xref rid="pone.0002033-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In green algae and land plants, which are the focus of this work, the antenna system is composed of Light Harvesting Complex (Lhc) proteins which have three transmembrane helices and bind Chl a, b and xanthophylls <xref rid="pone.0002033-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Two sub-classes of Lhc proteins are preferentially associated with PSI or PSII and are defined as Lhca and Lhcb, respectively <xref rid="pone.0002033-Jansson2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, six different polypeptides were identified for PSI (Lhca1-6) and eight for PSII (Lhcb1-8), including the recently proposed additions, Lhcb7 and Lhcb8 <xref rid="pone.0002033-Jansson2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002033-Klimmek1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>As mentioned above, antenna proteins play a role in increasing light harvesting and energy transfer to reaction centers. However, light is not always a limiting factor and photosynthetic organisms are often exposed to conditions where absorbed energy exceeds their capacity for electron transport <xref rid="pone.0002033-Barber1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The presence of excess energy in the form of <sup>1</sup>Chl&#x0002a; excited states is dangerous for the cell, since <sup>3</sup>Chl&#x0002a;, produced by intersystem crossing, can easily react with molecular oxygen and produce reactive species, especially singlet oxygen <xref rid="pone.0002033-Barber1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002033-Niyogi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Several photoprotection mechanisms have evolved to prevent/reduce the damage caused by excess energy <xref rid="pone.0002033-Niyogi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002033-DemmigAdams1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Although these mechanisms appear to be interdependent and overlapping they lead to photoprotection on different time scales. The fastest photoprotection mechanism is called Non Photochemical Quenching (NPQ) which consists of thermal dissipation of the excess <sup>1</sup>Chl&#x0002a; states. NPQ is activated within seconds of a change in light intensity and its action was proven to be of particular importance under rapidly changing light conditions <xref rid="pone.0002033-Kulheim1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The fastest NPQ component is dependent on lumen acidification and the presence of a Lhc-like protein, PsbS <xref rid="pone.0002033-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. On a minutes time scale after the onset of a light stress, zeaxanthin is synthesized from violaxanthin, in a process known as the xanthophyll cycle <xref rid="pone.0002033-DemmigAdams1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Zeaxanthin is a carotenoid with multiple roles in photoprotection: it enhances NPQ itself <xref rid="pone.0002033-Niyogi2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, it establishes a long term quenching effect by binding to Lhc proteins <xref rid="pone.0002033-DallOsto1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and it contributes to ROS scavenging <xref rid="pone.0002033-Havaux1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. On a longer time scale, photosynthetic organisms acclimate to light regimes by activating several responses such as antenna size regulation and modulation of metabolic sinks <xref rid="pone.0002033-Walters1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Members of the Lhc multigene family are involved in all these photoprotection mechanisms, regardless of their activation time scale. All proteins do not have equivalent functions, however, and play prominent roles either in light harvesting or photoprotection <xref rid="pone.0002033-Horton1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>In organisms belonging to the Streptophyta, other polypeptides show significant homology to Lhc proteins. These have a different structural organization to Lhc, with a variable number of transmembrane helices but share an evolutionary origin from a single helix ancestor <xref rid="pone.0002033-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. These gene products were proposed to be specialized in photoprotection and adaptation to different light environments <xref rid="pone.0002033-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, a hypothesis well supported by experimental data in the case of PsbS <xref rid="pone.0002033-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> but still under debate for ELIPs <xref rid="pone.0002033-Hutin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002033-TzvetkovaChevolleau1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>Research on the Lhc multigene family has focused mainly on seed plants and, secondarily, on algae (green, brown, red algae, diatoms). Little information is available on bryophytes (mosses, liverworts, hornworts), which diverged from the ancestor of seed plants more than 400 million years ago, during the first phase of colonization of the aerial environment <xref rid="pone.0002033-Falkowski1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. As a lineage, mosses are a crucial group for understanding the transition to life on land: most moss vegetative tissues are haploid like their green algal ancestors, but the needle-like shoots that produce spores (sporophytes) display key innovations for life outside water, such as stomata and simple strands of conductive cells <xref rid="pone.0002033-Cove1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002033-Rensing1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The analysis of bryophytes, thus, could help identify genes which evolved early after the transition from aquatic to terrestrial life. This is of particular interest for photosynthetic organisms because new challenges were associated with sub-aerial life such as direct illumination and fast O<sub>2</sub> diffusion, all factors causing enhanced photo-oxidative stress, a major limitation for plant growth.</p><p>In this study, we characterized the antenna proteins in the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>, by analyzing their sequence, their biochemical properties and function. We first identified the Lhc and Lhc-like polypeptides of this organism by exploiting EST databases and the recently completed genome sequence <xref rid="pone.0002033-Rensing1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002033-Quatrano1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. By comparison with antenna proteins from other green lineage organisms, we showed that some Lhc polypeptides, notably Lhcb3 and Lhcb6, are detectable only in land plants, suggesting they may play a role in adaptation to aerial environments. This hypothesis is consistent with other physiological adaptations by <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>: this moss showed a capacity for activating Lhc-dependent mechanisms in response to environmental conditions in a similar fashion to seed plants. One major difference with seed plants was that an Lhca4 ortholog was absent in <italic>P. patens</italic>. By analyzing low temperature fluorescence spectra, we showed that the lack of Lhca4 is consistent with the content of red-shifted spectral forms observed in moss Photosystem I.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification and classification of the Lhc sequence family in Physcomitrella patens</title><p>Light harvesting proteins (Lhc) are members of a large multigene family and play an important role in the light phase of photosynthesis and response to environmental conditions. With the aim of characterizing this family in <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>, we first exploited the available sequence databases to identify moss Lhc family members in the genome.</p><p>We thus searched for contig sequences with significant homology to <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> Lhc polypeptides in the <italic>P. patens</italic> EST database (Physcobase, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://moss.nibb.ac.jp/">http://moss.nibb.ac.jp/</ext-link>). In cases where a positive result was obtained, we carried out further searches to identify all the EST clones corresponding to the contig, assuming that the number of clones gives an idea of the level of gene expression. In a few cases, clones without a corresponding contig were identified and assembled from individual sequences. Sequencing of the entire <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> genome was completed very recently and it was used to confirm the EST sequences <xref rid="pone.0002033-Rensing1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002033-Quatrano1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In most cases, the sequences retrieved from the two databases were identical; however, by using this additional information we were also able to identify a few new genes, as reported below. The first result obtained from is that the Lhc multigene family contains more members in <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> than <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The presence of a large number of Lhc polypeptides in <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> was suggested by a previous study <xref rid="pone.0002033-Hofmann1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and is likely due to recent duplication of part of the <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> genome <xref rid="pone.0002033-MarkmannMulisch1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>In order to classify the <italic>P. patens</italic> Lhc proteins, sequences retrieved were compared to sequences from other organisms belonging to the green lineage. In this analysis we included some fully sequenced organisms which diverged at different times during evolution: i) <italic>Ostreococcus tauri</italic>, which is the smallest free-living eukaryote identified to date and belongs to the Prasinophyceae class, one of the most ancient clade among Chlorophyta <xref rid="pone.0002033-Courties1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. ii) <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, a model organism for photosynthetic unicellular eukaryotes, also belonging to Chlorophyta <xref rid="pone.0002033-Courties2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>; iii-iv) <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>Populus spp.</italic>, as model organisms for dicotyledons, and v) <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> for monocots. Lhc protein sequences from these organisms were obtained from previous studies <xref rid="pone.0002033-Jansson2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002033-Klimmek1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002033-Six1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002033-Koziol1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. We also included sequences retrieved from EST databases representing several different algae species: among these <italic>Mesostigma viride</italic> is worth mentioning because it is an alga belonging to Streptophyta <xref rid="pone.0002033-Turmel1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002033-Lemieux1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, and thus diverged from land plants ancestor later than Chlorophyta.</p><p>As expected, the sequence alignment showed that Lhc proteins from <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> are more similar to plant genes than to algal counterparts. Therefore, when possible, the <italic>P. patens</italic> nomenclature followed that of the nearest <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> gene, as reported in supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002033.s001">figure S1</xref>. When multiple isoforms of the same gene were present, they were numbered starting from the isoform showing the highest number of EST clones in the database, assuming their number is proportional to gene expression level.</p><p>It was not always clearly straightforward to assign a direct ortholog relationship between <italic>P. patens</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes. For the major antenna complex of Photosystem II (LHCII), several proteins showed high similarity to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 but it was not possible to find a direct correspondence to a specific <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> isoform. To avoid any confusion with the cases where a direct ortholog was found, constituents of the LHCII major antenna complex were named Lhcbm, according to <xref rid="pone.0002033-Koziol1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002033-Elrad1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>No <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> orthologs of AtLhca4 and AtLhca6 (At, <italic>A. thaliana</italic>) were found. In the case of AtLhca5, an ortholog was found in the genome database but not among EST sequences, suggesting that, in <italic>Physcomitrella,</italic> Lhca5 is not expressed or only in special growth conditions different from those used for EST library construction. This is a peculiarity of this subunit, since all other <italic>Lhc</italic> sequences present in the genome database were highly represented in expressed sequence libraries.</p><p>Interestingly, we also identified a new Lhc protein specific to <italic>Physcomitrella</italic>.

<xref rid="pone.0002033-Stauber1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. For this reason, we confirmed the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002033-g001">figure 1</xref> by producing another set of trees with an increased number of Lhca sequences, which is reported in additional materials (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002033.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). In both cases we clearly found that at least one Lhca1 and Lhca3 isoform is conserved in all the fully sequenced species included in the study: this conservation was especially remarkable for Lhca3 with small sequence differences observed between <italic>A. thaliana, P. patens, C. reinhardtii</italic> and <italic>O. tauri</italic>. Four different AtLhca2 orthologs were found in <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> and these clustered with other plant Lhca2 isoforms. In the case of algae, we detected several sequences with significant similarity to Lhca2 <xref rid="pone.0002033-Stauber1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Although the degree of similarity was clearly lower with respect to Lhca1 and Lhca3, at least one Lhca2-like polypeptide was present in all six fully sequenced organisms. We could not find obvious AtLhca4 and AtLhca6 orthologs in <italic>P. patens</italic> in either the EST or genomic databases.

AtLhca4 also shares some similarity with Lhca2 but orthologs of this polypeptide are found only in other seed plants (both monocots and dicots) and not in the other species analyzed here, including in <italic>P. patens</italic>.

An exception appears to be Lhcb3, the third component of LHCII trimers in seed plants, which does not form a group with Lhcb1-2 or Lhcbm and has subunit-specific features regardless of species. For example, as can be seen in the alignment shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002033.s006">Fig. S6</xref>, two amino acid residues are conserved in Lhcb3 isoforms in different species but not in all other Lhcbm polypeptides.

Sequences with the highest level of conservation belong to seed plants and all contain N as the ligand for Chl A5, both in monocots and dicots. Among non seed plants, a sequence identifiable as Lhca4 was found only in the lycophyte <italic>Selaginella moellendorffii</italic> and the liverwort <italic>Marchantia polymorpha.</italic> When the search was limited to algae, the retrieved sequences not only showed a lower level of similarity but also a histidine residue as the Chl A5 ligand.

Consistently, the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> PSI antenna has a smaller red shift and fluorescence emission peaks around 715 nm <xref rid="pone.0002033-Bassi1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Thus, although homologous sequences for Lhca proteins are present in both Chlorophyta and Streptophyta, the specific combination responsible for the strong red shift in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Lhca4 evolved only in plants early after land colonization.</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, besides Lhca4, red-shifted forms (emitting at 725 nm) are also associated with Lhca3, which carries an asparagine residue as a ligand for Chl A5 <xref rid="pone.0002033-Morosinotto2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Lhca3 orthologs with the conserved asparagine Chl A5 ligand are present in <italic>Physcomitrella</italic>. <italic>In vitro</italic> reconstitution experiments with PpLhca3.1-2 demonstrated these proteins have LT fluorescence at 725 nm, which is the same as for AtLhca3 (not shown). Thus, this subunit is most likely responsible for red-most emission in <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> cells.</p><p>Interestingly, while Lhca3 is clearly conserved in all members of the green lineage, Chl A5 ligand is not conserved and asparagine is not found in any algae species. This is the case of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> orthologs which have an histidine as the Chl A5 ligand and the PSI antenna consistently shows a smaller red shift (<italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, <xref rid="pone.0002033-Bassi1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>) or is missing red emitting forms (<italic>O. tauri</italic>, <xref rid="pone.0002033-Six1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>). In <italic>Mesostigma viride,</italic> which is a Streptophyta as well as plants, the Lhca3 sequence contains a histidine as the Chl A5 ligand and thus smaller red-shifted forms are likely. On the contrary, in all plant species analyzed, included non-seed species (<italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic>, <italic>Selaginella moellendorffii</italic>, <italic>Ceratopteris richardii</italic>) all Lhca3 sequences contained an asparagine as the Chl A5 ligand suggesting red-shifted emission. These results suggest that during the evolution of the Streptophyta towards seed plants there was a progressive increase in the amplitude of red forms relative to bulk Chl absorption and a wavelength shift towards lower energy. A possible explanation is that absorption at longer wavelengths provided a significant advantage in the terrestrial environment. In fact, because long wavelengths are preferentially absorbed by water, red Chl forms may not provide a significant contribution to photosynthesis. By contrast, these wavelengths constitute a significant part of the light spectrum in the aerial environment, especially under shade conditions within a canopy <xref rid="pone.0002033-Rivadossi1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. An additional/alternative explanation is that these chlorophylls could contribute to photoprotection from light excess. In fact, the pronounced red Chl forms funnel singlet excited states to sites where any Chl triplet that is generated can be effectively quenched by nearby carotenoids <xref rid="pone.0002033-Carbonera1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002033-Croce1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Thus, the presence of Chl molecules with low energy levels would help plants resist the increased photo-oxidative stress experienced in sub-aerial environments.</p><p>The presence of such red-shifted Chls in the PSI-LHCI supercomplex of land organisms also has consequences on energy distribution: at room temperature approximately 90&#x00025; of excited states are localized in red forms and then transferred to the reaction center <xref rid="pone.0002033-Croce2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. This peculiar energy distribution does not have effects on the overall photochemical efficiency because PSI is very efficient in charge separation and PSII, which is slower, is excitonically separated from PSI being segregated in grana <xref rid="pone.0002033-Trissl1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002033-Dekker1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. It is interesting to mention that the thylakoid organization with grana stacking was shown to be generally absent in most algal species. In fact, although some thylakoid appression is found in many algae, an organization as higher plants grana was found only in later taxa of the Streptophyta line (Coleochaetales and Charales) <xref rid="pone.0002033-Larkum1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002033-Gunning1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. It thus tempting to hypothesize that these differences are somehow correlated: evolution of grana stacking may have allowed the presence of strong red-shifted forms in Photosystem I, without causing spillover and reduction of PSII photochemical efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>The PSII antenna system in photosynthetic eukaryotes: adaptations to the aerial environment</title><p>The major PSII antenna in seed plants is composed of the Lhcb1, Lhcb2 and Lhcb3 proteins. Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 are highly similar and are present in multiple copies (5 and 4 respectively in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <xref rid="pone.0002033-Jansson2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>), whereas Lhcb3 is more divergent, is encoded by a single copy gene and was shown to have distinct biochemical and spectroscopic properties <xref rid="pone.0002033-Caffarri1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Homologous proteins are present in many other plants and algae species (called Lhcbm), except for <italic>Ostreoccoccus</italic> where no ortholog was found and the major antenna complex is composed of Lhcp polypeptides, typical of prasinophytes <xref rid="pone.0002033-Six1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Despite their absence in <italic>O. tauri</italic>, however, Lhcbm-like polypeptides were found in all other species analyzed from both Streptophyta and Chlorophyta: it is thus highly likely that these subunits appeared very early during green algae evolution, before the divergence of these two phyla.</p><p>Similarly to seed plants, in <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> and all other algae species analyzed in this study, major LHCII components are present in multiple copies. Nevertheless, these genes are more similar to each other than to proteins from other organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002033-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Our sequence comparison (e.g. Helix B domain alignment shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002033.s006">Figure S6</xref>) clearly highlighted only a few amino acid substitutions which appear to be species-specific. On this basis we conclude that the genes encoding the major LHCII trimeric complex differentiated after species divergence. This strong independent tendency among all the organisms examined for multiple genes encoding multiple LHCII isoforms, suggests the action of a selection pressure. This selection pressure was also present in <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> which also has multiple copies of the genes encoding its major antenna. One possible explanation is that different isoforms play specialized roles under different environmental conditions. However, the sequence singularities of each isoform are generally very small and, although the possibility could not be excluded, it seems unlikely that these could confer an individual specialized function on each polypeptide. Furthermore, the <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution of different barley Lhcb1 isoforms showed that, at least in the monomeric form, their spectroscopic and pigment binding properties were essentially identical <xref rid="pone.0002033-Frigerio1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>.</p><p>An alternative explanation could be the need for high expression levels of the LHCII antenna complex. Considering that this major antenna complex is very abundant and plays a fundamental role both in light harvesting and photoprotection <xref rid="pone.0002033-Pascal1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, its expression level probably responds to contrasting stimuli. For example, it has been shown that the LHCII polypeptide content is reduced in high light conditions <xref rid="pone.0002033-Ballottari2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, but also that at least one trimer per PSII core is always maintained even in extreme light stress <xref rid="pone.0002033-Morosinotto3" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. A single copy gene, with a unique promoter and a relatively small number of regulatory regions, may not sustain this massive and regulated protein expression, whereas multiple copies may achieve an optimal integrated regulation of the LHCII content. The observation that different Lhcb1 isoforms, although very similar, are distinctly regulated according to environmental conditions <xref rid="pone.0002033-Caffarri2" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref> fits with this hypothesis.</p><p>Lhcb3 shows a different pattern from the other LHCII polypeptides: sequence differences are subunit-specific rather than species-specific. Indeed, biochemical studies in barley and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> showed that Lhcb3 has properties which are distinct from those of Lhcb1-2 <xref rid="pone.0002033-Caffarri1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002033-Standfuss1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. A Lhcb3 ortholog is present in seed plants <xref rid="pone.0002033-Klimmek1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> and other non-seed plants, but not in any green algae analyzed so far <xref rid="pone.0002033-Koziol1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, suggesting a specialized role for this polypeptide within LHCII, possibly related to life in land environments.</p><p>Lhcb6 also appeared during the evolution of land plants and no ortholog is found in algae, either in EST or genomic databases <xref rid="pone.0002033-Koziol1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Lhcb6 was proposed to play a structural role in PSII supercomplexes: in plants depleted of this polypeptide, the PSII core association of a subpopulation of LHCII trimers, the M-trimers, was destabilized <xref rid="pone.0002033-Morosinotto3" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002033-Kovacs1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>.

Considering that Lhcb3 is enriched in M-trimers, it is tempting to speculate that the evolution of these two proteins in land plants allowed the differentiation of different trimeric LHCII complexes within PSII supercomplexes.</p><p>In addition to this structural role, Lhcb6 may be involved in the regulation of light harvesting. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants depleted in Lhcb6 showed a strong reduction in NPQ <xref rid="pone.0002033-Kovacs1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. Thus the presence of Lhcb6 (and possibly Lhcb3) may be correlated with the presence of a fully active NPQ in <italic>P. patens</italic> and seed plants, in a different scenario from green algae where Lhcb6 is absent and NPQ works via a different mechanism <xref rid="pone.0002033-Finazzi1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Following this sequence of events, the evolution of Lhcb6 (and Lhcb3) in organisms emerging from aquatic environments led to improved adaptation to the aerial environment by leading to NPQ in the form now found in seed plants. In conclusion, although not all mechanisms are fully understood, the hypothesis that, besides PsbS, Lhcb6 and possibly Lhcb3 play a relevant role in regulating PSII antenna function is worth verifying by future research.</p><p>Finally, other Lhcb polypeptides appeared only at later stages in the evolution of the green lineage: Lhcb7, Lhcb8 and Lhcb9. Lhcb7 is specific for land plants, whereas Lhcb8 is typical of dicots only. Lhcb9, on the contrary, is only found in <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> and no ortholog was found in any other organism, including non- seed plants. This peculiar distribution suggests that the function of this protein is limited. Its high expression level, however, as judged from the number of EST clones, leaves open the possibility that it may play a specific role in the <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> growth environment. For example, sunflecks are particularly dangerous for deep-shade plants because the sudden transition from low to high light drives triplet and reactive species formation: Lhcb9 could play a protecting role in these particular conditions, although other scenarios are also possible.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Phylogeny of Lhc-like sequences: evolution of photoprotection mechanisms</title><p>In <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> sequence databases we also identified several Lhc-like proteins, which show far less conservation than Lhc complexes <xref rid="pone.0002033-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002033-Heddad1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>.
