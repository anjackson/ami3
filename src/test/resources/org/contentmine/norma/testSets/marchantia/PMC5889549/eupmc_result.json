    "Pathogen perception by plants is mediated by plasma membrane-localized immune receptors that have varied extracellular domains. Lectin receptor kinases (LecRKs) are among these receptors and are subdivided into 3 classes, C-type LecRKs (C-LecRKs), L-type LecRKs (L-LecRKs) and G-type LecRKs (G-LecRKs). While C-LecRKs are represented by one or two members in all plant species investigated and have unknown functions, L-LecRKs have been characterized in a few plant species and have been shown to play roles in plant defense against pathogens. Whereas Arabidopsis G-LecRKs have been characterized, this family of LecRKs has not been studied in tomato.This investigation updates the current characterization of Arabidopsis G-LecRKs and characterizes the tomato G-LecRKs, using LecRKs from the monocot rice and the basal eudicot columbine to establish a basis for comparisons between the two core eudicots. Additionally, revisiting parameters established for Arabidopsis nomenclature for LecRKs is suggested for both Arabidopsis and tomato. Moreover, using phylogenetic analysis, we show the relationship among and between members of G-LecRKs from all three eudicot plant species. Furthermore, investigating presence of motifs in G-LecRKs we identified conserved motifs among members of G-LecRKs in tomato and Arabidopsis, with five present in at least 30 of the 38 Arabidopsis members and in at least 45 of the 73 tomato members.This work characterized tomato G-LecRKs and added members to the currently characterized Arabidopsis G-LecRKs. Additionally, protein sequence analysis showed an expansion of this family in tomato as compared to Arabidopsis, and the existence of conserved common motifs in the two plant species as well as conserved species-specific motifs."
