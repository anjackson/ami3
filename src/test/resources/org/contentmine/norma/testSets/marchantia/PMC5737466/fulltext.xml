Expansion of such gene families has been previously found to coincide with the evolution of morphological complexity, although comparative analyses have been hampered by severe sampling bias. Here, we make use of the recently increased availability of plant genomes. We have updated and expanded previous rule sets for domain-based classification of transcription associated proteins (TAPs), comprising transcription factors and transcriptional regulators. The genome-wide annotation of these protein families has been analyzed and made available via the novel TAPscan web interface. We find that many TAP families previously thought to be specific for land plants actually evolved in streptophyte (charophyte) algae; 26 out of 36 TAP family gains are inferred to have occurred in the common ancestor of the Streptophyta (uniting the land plants&#x02014;Embryophyta&#x02014;with their closest algal relatives). In contrast, expansions of TAP families were found to occur throughout streptophyte evolution. 17 out of 76 expansion events were found to be common to all land plants and thus probably evolved concomitant with the water-to-land-transition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Charophyta</kwd><kwd>Streptophyta</kwd><kwd>Embryophyta</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>land plant</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcriptional regulation is carried out by transcription associated proteins (TAPs), comprising transcription factors (TFs, binding in sequence-specific manner to <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements to enhance or repress transcription), transcriptional regulators (TRs, acting as part of the transcription core complex, via unspecific binding, protein&#x02013;protein interaction or chromatin modification) and putative TAPs (PTs), the role of which needs to be determined (<xref rid="evx258-B55" ref-type="bibr">Richardt et&#x000a0;al. 2007</xref>).</p><p>The complexity of transcriptional regulation (as measured by the genomes&#x02019; potential to encode TAPs, i.e., total number of TAP genes per genome) coincides with the morphological complexity (typically measured by number of cell types) of plants and animals (<xref rid="evx258-B39" ref-type="bibr">Levine and Tjian 2003</xref>; <xref rid="evx258-B35" ref-type="bibr">Lang et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evx258-B10" ref-type="bibr">de Mendoza et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evx258-B34" ref-type="bibr">Lang and Rensing 2015</xref>). Comparative studies in plants and animals have revealed gains, losses and expansions of key gene families, and demonstrated the unicellular ancestors of plants and animals had already gained much of the families known as important and typical for these lineages (<xref rid="evx258-B35" ref-type="bibr">Lang et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evx258-B10" ref-type="bibr">de Mendoza et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evx258-B11" ref-type="bibr">de Mendoza et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="evx258-B6" ref-type="bibr">Catarino et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>). The recent initial analysis of data from streptophyte algae (sharing common ancestry with land plants) suggested that the origin of TAPs considered to be specific for land plants needs to be revised (<xref rid="evx258-B27" ref-type="bibr">Hori et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evx258-B14" ref-type="bibr">Delaux et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="evx258-B65" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>), which we set out to do here by including more data of streptophyte algae and bryophytes than previously available.</p><p>Transcription associated proteins, and in particular TFs, are important signaling components and as such often key regulators of developmental progressions. They evolve via duplication, paralog retention and subsequent sub- and neofunctionalization (<xref rid="evx258-B52" ref-type="bibr">Rensing 2014</xref>), leading to a high abundance and combinatorial complexity of these proteins in the most complex multicellular lineages (that perform embryogenesis)&#x02014;namely plants and animals (<xref rid="evx258-B10" ref-type="bibr">de Mendoza et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evx258-B34" ref-type="bibr">Lang and Rensing 2015</xref>; <xref rid="evx258-B53" ref-type="bibr">Rensing 2016</xref>).</p><p>Many plant TFs have initially been described as regulators of organ development or stress responses of flowering plants. However, by broadening the view to other plants it became clear that, for example LFY, initially described in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> as determining the floral fate of meristems and regulating flower patterning, controls the first division of the zygote in the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> (<xref rid="evx258-B62" ref-type="bibr">Tanahashi et&#x000a0;al. 2005</xref>). Also, the flowering plant meristem controlling WOX genes have orthologs in moss that are involved in apical stem cell formation (<xref rid="evx258-B57" ref-type="bibr">Sakakibara et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). Such homeodomain (HD) TFs have deep eukaryotic roots and control important developmental progressions, for example, in embryogenesis, in plants, and animals (<xref rid="evx258-B29" ref-type="bibr">Hudry et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evx258-B6" ref-type="bibr">Catarino et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>). The KNOX and BELL subfamilies of plant HD proteins control mating types of green algae (<xref rid="evx258-B38" ref-type="bibr">Lee et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>) and evolved into controlling cell fate determination of flowering plant stem cells (<xref rid="evx258-B23" ref-type="bibr">Hay and Tsiantis 2010</xref>). TF gene regulatory network kernels that were present in the earliest land plants are often modified and coopted during evolution (<xref rid="evx258-B48" ref-type="bibr">Pires et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>), and plant TF paralogs are preferentially retained after whole genome duplication (WGD) events (<xref rid="evx258-B9" ref-type="bibr">De Bodt et&#x000a0;al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="evx258-B35" ref-type="bibr">Lang et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>). TRs do not show the same tendency as TFs to expand with complexity, but they are important regulators nevertheless. For example, epigenetic control of important developmental steps like body plan control is maintained via components of the Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins throughout land plants (<xref rid="evx258-B41" ref-type="bibr">Mosquna et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evx258-B43" ref-type="bibr">Okano et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evx258-B2" ref-type="bibr">Bouyer et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>).</p><p>Transcription associated proteins are thus key to understanding development and evolution of plant form and function. Access to reliable, up-to-date classification of TAPs is important, and enables comparative analyses informing our knowledge of plant transcriptional regulation. In a previous study (<xref rid="evx258-B35" ref-type="bibr">Lang et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>) we combined rule sets of three studies (<xref rid="evx258-B54" ref-type="bibr">Riano-Pachon et&#x000a0;al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="evx258-B55" ref-type="bibr">Richardt et&#x000a0;al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="evx258-B20" ref-type="bibr">Guo et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>) to generate the comprehensive TAPscan tool, encompassing sensitive domain-based classification rules for 111 TAP families. Similar approaches were undertaken by other studies, for example, PlnTFDB (<xref rid="evx258-B46" ref-type="bibr">Perez-Rodriguez et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>), iTAK (<xref rid="evx258-B68" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>), or PlantTFDB (<xref rid="evx258-B30" ref-type="bibr">Jin et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>). We have now expanded our methodology by switching to HMMER v3, by updating the Hidden Markov Models (HMM) of many of the domains, and by including novel subfamily classification for several families. Moreover, we have included 92 more genomes than were available 7 years ago, dramatically improving taxon sampling. Here, we present an updated comprehensive analysis of TAP evolution of the green lineage as well as the TAPscan v2 web interface (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://plantco.de/tapscan/">http://plantco.de/tapscan/</ext-link>), including precomputed gene trees. This interface is a successor to PlnTFDB v3.0 (<xref rid="evx258-B46" ref-type="bibr">Perez-Rodriguez et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>), encompasses the most comprehensive set of plant TAPs, and represents a novel tool for the plant community to access, screen and download genome-wide TAP annotations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Data Set</title><p>In our previous analysis (<xref rid="evx258-B35" ref-type="bibr">Lang et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>) no streptophyte algae, no gymnosperms and only a single bryophyte genome were covered.

With this new version, HMMER abandoned its glocal (global/local) approach, the alignment of a complete model to a subsection of a protein, to exclusively use local alignments. This change made it possible to make use of how much of the respective HMM profile was matched per alignment. This information was implemented in our TAPscan pipeline as a dynamic coverage cutoff aimed to introduce a higher level of strictness to maintain sequence and functional conservation. For our custom-built profiles we set this cutoff to 75% based on manual inspection of the alignments (cf. Results). For the PFAM profiles we calculated the proportion of 100% conservation in each profiles&#x02019; seed alignment and used this as minimum coverage cutoff (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online). Out of the 124 HMM profiles published in 2010 (<xref rid="evx258-B35" ref-type="bibr">Lang et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>), 108 had been obtained from the PFAM database (PFAM 23.0) and were again downloaded directly from the PFAM database (PFAM 29.0).</p></sec><sec><title>Updating the Custom-Built HMM Profiles</title><p>The 16 domains represented by custom-made profiles had to be updated separately. They were first checked against the PFAM database to see if any equivalent profiles could be found, which was true only for NAC/NAM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online). To increase the sequence diversity underlying the HMM profiles we decided to not directly reuse the profile multiple sequence alignments published earlier (<xref rid="evx258-B35" ref-type="bibr">Lang et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>), but instead to use the output of these profiles when run against a database of 46 genomes representing 12 diverse groups of organisms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online; 2x animals, 1x bryophyte, 8x chlorophytes, 1&#x000d7; conifer, 9&#x000d7; dicots, 1&#x000d7; lycophyte, 6&#x000d7; fungi, 1&#x000d7; glaucophyte, 4&#x000d7; monocots, 1&#x000d7; charophyte, 7&#x000d7; protoctista [5&#x000d7; nongreen algae, 1&#x000d7; Mycetozoa, 1&#x000d7; Heterolobosea], and 5&#x000d7; rhodophytes). To avoid sequences not encompassing the major part of the domain of interest, hit length and model usage had to be at least 75% of the model length, as mentioned above. For each of the 12 clades four sequences were sampled (if possible), before random sampling collected the remaining sequences to reach 50 sequences. If 50 sequences could not be sampled, due to too few hits in the 2010 (v1) output, all hits were used for building a new model. To measure the variability in the phylogenetically guided sampling approach it was repeated nine times.

S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online for expanded version). Cluster 5 contains families (such as bZIP, bHLH, or MYB) that were already abundant in the algal relatives of land plants, whereas cluster 3 contains TAPs that expanded in land plants and again in seed plants, such as NAC or ABI3/VP1. The intervening cluster 4 contains families that show high abundance throughout, like HD or RWP-RK. The biggest cluster (1) contains families that show either only gradual expansion from algae (bottom of figure) to flowering plants (top of figure), or no expansion at all. Consequently, cluster 1 contains many TRs, which have previously shown not to be subject to as much expansion as TFs (<xref rid="evx258-B35" ref-type="bibr">Lang et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>). The small cluster 2 next to cluster 1 harbors families of spurious presence, like those that evolved in vascular plants (Tracheophyta; like NZZ or ULT). In general, the heatmap visualizes a principal gain of (primarily) TF paralogs within existing families concomitant with the terrestrialization of plants (cf. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary fig. S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online). Interestingly, the propensity of TAPs to comprise of more than one functional domain increases in a very similar pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary fig. S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online), akin to the domain combination tendency generally seen for plants (<xref rid="evx258-B33" ref-type="bibr">Kersting et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>). Hence, the combinatorial potential of TFs clearly coincides with increasing morphological complexity (as measured by number of cell types), corroborating earlier results (<xref rid="evx258-B35" ref-type="bibr">Lang et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evx258-B34" ref-type="bibr">Lang and Rensing 2015</xref>).

The streptophyte alga <italic>Klebsormidium nitens</italic> apparently secondarily lost five TAP families, whereas the lycophyte <italic>Selaginella moellendorffii</italic> lost eight. Another eight families were lost during gymnosperm evolution, one of them (HD_Pintox) being absent from all studied gymnosperms, whereas two are lacking in conifers and five in <italic>Ginkgo</italic> (e.g., LFY&#x02014;although a lacking gene model would be an alternative explanation). A total of 76 expansions were detected, of which the highest number (17.22%) are inferred to have occurred in the lineage that led to the last common ancestor of all land plants. All other expansions show a scattered distribution along the deep as well as distal nodes of the tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evx258-F5">fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>). The 13 inferred family contractions also display a patchy pattern. Strikingly, out of 36 TAP family gains 26 are predicted to have occurred in streptophyte algae (nodes 34-30). Another five are synapomorphic of land plants (Embryophyta), whereas only 2, 1, and 1 are evolutionary novelties of vascular plants, Euphyllophyta, and Eudicots, respectively.

Streptophyte algae are sister to land plants and thus ideally suited, together with bryophyte sequences, to elucidate whether gains occurred prior or after terrestrialization. Although only two genomes of strepptophyte algae have yet been published (<xref rid="evx258-B27" ref-type="bibr">Hori et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evx258-B14" ref-type="bibr">Delaux et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>), there are transcriptome data available for seven species (<xref rid="evx258-B63" ref-type="bibr">Timme et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>) that were included into TAPscan (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evx258-T1">table&#x000a0;1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table S5/S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online). Similarly, although no other bryophyte genomes than <italic>P. patens</italic> are published yet, we included transcriptomes of the mosses <italic>Ceratodon purpureus</italic> (<xref rid="evx258-B60" ref-type="bibr">Szovenyi et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>) and <italic>Funaria hygrometrica</italic> (<xref rid="evx258-B61" ref-type="bibr">Szovenyi et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>), and of the liverwort <italic>Marchantia polymoprha</italic> (<xref rid="evx258-B58" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>a). Out of 20 TAP families previously thought to have been gained with terrestrialization (<xref rid="evx258-B35" ref-type="bibr">Lang et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>), only VOZ and bHLH_TCP could be confirmed. Of the others, three (ARF, S1Fa-like, and O-FucT) are already present in Rhodophyta, Chlorophyta, or both. Strikingly, the vast majority of these 20 families (15) are present in Charophyta (comprising all lineages of streptophyte algae), but not Chlorophyta or Rhodophyta (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online). Hence, they were most probably gained during the evolution of the Streptophyta (uniting the Charophyta with the land plants). Out of these 15 families, 11 are already present in the KCM grade (encompassing Klebsormidiales, Chlorokybales, and Mesostigmatales and sister to the ZCC grade and land plants), whereas 4 (Aux/IAA, DUF632 domain containing, GRAS and HRT) are present only in the ZCC grade (encompassing Zygnematales, Coleochaetales, and Charales, together with the land plants comprising the Phragmoplastophyta). This finding is in line with the emerging evidence that in particular ZCC species share many unique features with land plants like polyplastidy (<xref rid="evx258-B13" ref-type="bibr">de Vries et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>) or the phragmoplast (<xref rid="evx258-B47" ref-type="bibr">Pickett-Heaps et&#x000a0;al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="evx258-B4" ref-type="bibr">Buschmann and Zachgo 2016</xref>), and that Klebsormidium also possesses some &#x0201c;plant-like&#x0201d; features, like callose and the phenylpropanoid pathway (<xref rid="evx258-B24" ref-type="bibr">Herburger and Holzinger 2015</xref>; <xref rid="evx258-B12" ref-type="bibr">de Vries et&#x000a0;al. 2017</xref>). Based on our findings, the last common ancestor of streptophytes had already evolved 11 TAP families previously thought to be land plant-specific, and the last common ancestor of Phragmoplastophyta (ZCC grade algae and land plants) another five families. Prominent examples of these families are the TF families LFY and NAC (present already in <italic>K. nitens</italic>), as well as GRAS and Aux/IAA (present in the ZCC grade). Most of what we know about function of these TF families stems from research in flowering plants, and many of them control development of organs unique to flowering plants. It will therefore be intriguing to determine the putative ancestral function of these genes in the last common ancestor of streptophytes. As an example, a recent study showed that a <italic>P. patens</italic> TCP TF is involved in suppressing branching of the moss sporophyte (which is determinate since it does not branch) (<xref rid="evx258-B44" ref-type="bibr">Ortiz-Ramirez et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Origin and Expansion Revisited</title><p>Several of the gains previously inferred to have occurred in vascular plants, angiosperms or eudicotelydons can now be dated back to the common ancestors with streptophyte algae, bryophytes, ferns or lycophytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evx258-F5">fig.&#x000a0;5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table S6/S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online). Together with the families mentioned in the last paragraph, a total of 35 TAP families (most of them TFs) evolved at some point in the Archaeplastida, before the evolution of angiosperms, shifting the inferred gain dates back in time. Yet, out of 44 TAP families previously inferred to be expanded in land plants as compared with algae (<xref rid="evx258-B35" ref-type="bibr">Lang et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>), 21 show a &#x0003e;2-fold increase in the data presented here, and all 44 significantly more members (<italic>q</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, Mann&#x02013;Whitney) in land plants than in algae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online). These data suggest a primary burst of gain and expansion of TAPs concomitant with the origin of Streptophyta. The total numbers of TAPs, and in particular TFs, show a clear increase in the common ancestor of land plants, but also in some streptophyte algae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary fig. S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online). We expect that with more genomes of streptophyte algae becoming available the gain and expansion of even more families will be inferred to have occurred at earlier time points.</p><p>Of 22 families previously inferred to have been expanded in angiosperms (<xref rid="evx258-B35" ref-type="bibr">Lang et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>), the present data support 17 with a 2-fold change and 15 based on statistical testing (overlap 13; <italic>q</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online). Six TAP families expanded at the basis of angiosperms (among them HD_KNOX2), and several families expanded subsequently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evx258-F5">fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>). The subfunctionalization of such TAPs might be related to the more complex reproductive system of angiosperms. While most TF were already present in the earliest land plants, DBP and SAP appear first in vascular plants, ULT in the common ancestor of ferns and seed plants, and NZZ is unique to eudicots.</p><p>One of the major gaps in the previous sampling, besides the streptophyte algae, were gymnosperms. We have now included three conifers and <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic>. If we consider the inferred expansions based on the tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evx258-F5">fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>), a total of 13 expansions occur between the land plant node (29) and the angiosperms (25). Four TF families (BBR/BPC, CCAAT_HAP2, CCAAT_HAP3, and GeBP) were apparently expanded in the Euphyllophyta (ferns and seed plants, node 27), another three (HD_BEL, Pseudo ARR-B, and Whirly) in the seed plants. All these TF families are thus presumably important for spermatophyte evolution and development.</p><p>In a recent study (<xref rid="evx258-B6" ref-type="bibr">Catarino et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>), the authors had analyzed 48 plant TF families based on PlantTFDB classification rules (<xref rid="evx258-B31" ref-type="bibr">Jin et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>) in 15 species. In general, their inference of TF family gain is consistent with our data: of 38 families that can be compared, 30 are placed at the same node. For the remaining eight, our study places six at earlier nodes of the tree, probably due to better taxon sampling. The study also did a subfamily analysis of HD TFs and concluded that almost all were already present in algae. In our study, we find that of 12 HD subfamilies all but two (HD_BEL and HD_KNOX2) are detected in algae. We also compared gain of 40 TF families from (<xref rid="evx258-B30" ref-type="bibr">Jin et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>) with our data and can confirm their findings for 27 families. Out of the remaining 13, we detect 10 at earlier nodes in the tree, 4 of them in ZCC grade streptophyte algae instead of bryophytes, suggesting again that due to better sampling we infer family evolution more accurately. The <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> genome was published (<xref rid="evx258-B3" ref-type="bibr">Bowman et&#x000a0;al. 2017</xref>) during the time this manuscript was under review.

We detect 400 TFs, Bowman et al. 387 TFs; 33 out of 40 families are consistent; in the remaining seven cases the node of predicted origin varies due to different sampling.</p></sec><sec><title>Employing TAPscan Data</title><p>As an example on how the data presented with this study can be used, we selected the putative TAP family &#x0201c;DUF 632 domain containing.&#x0201d; This domain of unknown function (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pfam.xfam.org/family/PF04782">http://pfam.xfam.org/family/PF04782</ext-link>; last accessed December 8, 2017) is described as representing a potential leucine zipper, which is why it was initially defined as a putative TAP, PT (<xref rid="evx258-B55" ref-type="bibr">Richardt et&#x000a0;al. 2007</xref>). Our data show that this family first appears in the common ancestor of Coleochaetales, Zygnematales, and land plants (node 31) and is present throughout land plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evx258-F5">fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>). There are on average 19 family members in angiosperms, 7 in gymnosperms, 6 in bryophytes, and 3 in the streptophyte alga <italic>Coleochaete orbicularis</italic>. DUF 632 is part of cluster 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evx258-F4">fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>) that shows expansion during land plant evolution. It is not detected to be expanded using Wagner parsimony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evx258-F5">fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>), but shows significant size increase (<italic>q</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, Mann&#x02013;Whitney; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online) between nonseed plants and seed plants (fold change 2.95).</p><p>We selected protein sequences of this family using the TAPscan interface &#x0201c;family view&#x0201d; option, thus representing several angiosperm lineages as well as gymnosperms and nonseed plants. An alignment of the sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary fig. S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online) shows several highly conserved blocks, all of which feature positively charged as well as regularly spaced Leucine residues, reinforcing the notion of a potential DNA-binding Leucine zipper. Given the proposed structure we suggest to call this family Plant Leucine Zipper (PLZ) TFs. Phylogenetic inference shows that all nonseed plant sequences are present in the same subclade (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary fig. S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online; the same can be derived from the tree automatically inferred and available via the TAPscan web interface), this subclade is sister to approximately half of the seed plant sequences. Based on the structure of the tree, duplication and paralog retention occurred several times during seed plant evolution. Most of the paralogs were already established in the lineage leading to the last common ancestor of seed plants, whereas some duplications occurred only in angiosperms.</p><p>In order to understand under which conditions members of this protein family are active, we conducted expression profiling using existing data for <italic>P. patens</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref rid="evx258-B28" ref-type="bibr">Hruz et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evx258-B25" ref-type="bibr">Hiss et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="evx258-B26" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>, phytozome.org). Out of five&#x02009;<italic>P. patens</italic> genes detected by TAPscan, one appears to be a truncated pseudogene that was removed during alignment curation; another two genes are barely expressed. The remaining two genes (Pp3c16_15000V3.1 and Pp3c27_2840V3.1), however, show discrete expression profiles. The expression of both genes is higher under diurnal light and ammonia application. Pp3c16_15000V3.1 is more highly expressed upon heat stress, darkness and UV-B treatment, as well as in mature sporophytes and under biotic stimulus. Pp3c27_2840V3.1 is less expressed in gametophores (representing the late vegetative phase) as well as in mature sporophytes (i.e., adversely to the other gene). Similarly, ABA treatment leads to lower expression of Pp3c16_15000V3.1 and higher expression of Pp3c27_2840V3.1. The two <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genes most closely related to the nonseed plant clade, AT5G25590.1 and AT1G52320.2, show no particularly strong expression in any tissue or developmental stage, however, other members of the family show peaks in, for example, reproductive structures, xylem, or seed. AT1G52320.2 is induced, for example, under germination, drought and ABA, whereas AT5G25590.1 shows higher expression, for example, under UV-B, biotic stimulus, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and drought. In summary, members of the streptophyte-specific PLZ family appear to be differentially regulated under a range of abiotic and biotic stimuli as well as in different development stages. Such an expression profile fits that of a TF family undergoing paralog retention followed by sub and neofunctionalization of expression domains (<xref rid="evx258-B1" ref-type="bibr">Birchler and Veitia 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evx258-B52" ref-type="bibr">Rensing 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Outlook</title><p>Previous studies of land plant TAP evolution, like (<xref rid="evx258-B35" ref-type="bibr">Lang et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>), suffered from severe sampling bias, leading to many gains and expansions being either associated with the water to land transition (because they were inferred to have occurred between green algae and the moss <italic>P. patens</italic>), or the angiosperm radiation (since they occurred between the lycopyhte <italic>S. moellendorffii</italic> and angiosperms). Using better sampling, including streptophyte algae, more bryophytes, a fern and gymnosperms, we can now more accurately trace Viridiplantae TAP gains and expansions.
