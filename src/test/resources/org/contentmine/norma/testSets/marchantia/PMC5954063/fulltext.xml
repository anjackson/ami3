Unlike higher plants, flagellated cells are involved in reproduction of macro-algae as well as in early diverging land plants. <italic>Euglena gracilis</italic> is an emerging flagellated model organism. The current study reports that a specific calmodulin (CaM2) involved in gravitaxis of <italic>E. gracilis</italic> interacts with an evolutionary conserved flagellar protein, EgPCDUF4201. The subsequent molecular analysis showed clearly that EgPCDUF4201 is also involved in gravitaxis. We performed subcellular localization of CaM2 using immunoblotting and indirect immunofluorescence. By employing yeast two-hybrid screen, EgPCDUF4201 was identified as an interaction partner of CaM2. The C-terminus of EgPCDUF4201 is responsible for the interaction with CaM2. Silencing of N- and C-terminus of EgPCDUF4201 using RNAi resulted in an impaired gravitaxis. Moreover, indirect immunofluorescence assay showed that EgPCDUF4201 is a flagella associated protein. The current study specifically addressed some important questions regarding the signal transduction chain of gravitaxis in <italic>E. gracilis</italic>. Besides the fact that it improved the current understanding of gravity sensing mechanisms in <italic>E. gracilis</italic>, it also gave rise to several interesting research questions regarding the function of the domain of unknown function 4201 in flagellated cells.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2"><italic>Euglena gracilis</italic> is a photosynthetic, eukaryotic unicellular organism which is a member of the Euglenozoa along with the parasites of the genera <italic>Trypanozoma</italic> and <italic>Leishmania</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

Among these stimuli, light and gravity are of great importance for <italic>E. gracilis</italic> because a balance between negative gravitaxis (directional movement away from gravity) and positive phototaxis (directional movement towards light source) facilitate cells to reach an optimal niche in the water column<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Predominantly, <italic>E. gracilis</italic> shows a negative gravitaxis behavior. However, as shown under laboratory standard conditions cells show a transition from positive to negative gravitaxis as culture grows from young to old respectively. It has been demonstrated, in parabolic flight conditions (transition from hyper g to micro g as well as from micro g to hyper g), that this orientation is an active physiological process in which the beating of the flagella is involved and controlled by gravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The influence of microgravity conditions on gene expression has also been studied during a space craft flight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, the exact nature of the receptor responsible for gravitaxis has not yet been elucidated in <italic>E. gracilis</italic>. An initial inhibitor study established the involvement of stretch sensitive calcium ion channels (SSCIC) in gravitaxis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the involvement of a putative transient receptor potential (TRP) was suggested in a follow-up study using RNA interference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> (RNAi). However, additional studies are required in this direction as several putative stretch sensitive/mechanosensitive channels have been identified in the mRNA library of <italic>E. gracilis</italic> (unpublished data). Besides this open question regarding the exact nature of gravitaxis specific SSCIC, a reasonable progress has been made regarding the underlying molecular mechanism of gravitaxis in <italic>E. gracilis</italic>. For instance, a current working model of gravitaxis was established based on a series of experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The working model suggests that the SSCIC are activated as the cells deviate from their vertical swimming pathway leading to a calcium ion influx. In turn, calcium binds to a calmodulin that further activates an adenylyl cyclase. The resulting cAMP activates a protein kinase A which is suggested to modulate the functions of various proteins in the flagella. Recently, silencing of a specific protein kinase A (PKA) through RNAi elucidated its involvement in gravitaxis as well as in phototaxis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In another study, silencing the specific calmodulin 2 protein (CaM2) resulted only in impaired gravitaxis in <italic>E. gracilis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">This report provides information about&#x000a0;the subcellular localization of CaM2 as well as the identification of an interaction partner employing yeast two-hybrid screens.

Prior to the immuno-localization experiments, the specificity of the commercially raised genomic anti-CaM2 antibody was determined. Genomic antibodies facilitate the detection of an antigen in its denatured and native conformation, were used. Their reactivity to the <italic>E. gracilis</italic> protein lysate (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>) and to CaM2 fused to the Glutathion S Transferase (GST, Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>) was checked under denaturing conditions by Western blot. Both experiments showed a single band at the expected size. The specificity was further confirmed by generating a knockdown mutant (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>). The protein lysates from the wild type and the mutant were analyzed by Western blot with the anti-CaM2 antibody. Whereas the control with an anti-tubulin antibody showed an equal amount of proteins in the two samples, no protein could be detected in the knockdown mutant with the anti-CaM2 antibody. Altogether, this data confirmed the specificity of the anti-CaM2 antibody.</p><p id="Par7">The determination of CaM2 subcellular localization was carried out by cell fractionation studies followed by Western blot and by IIF assay. The separation of the cell body and the flagella fraction was performed and the purity was confirmed microscopically (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The quantitative Western blot clearly showed that CaM2 was abundant in the cell body fraction, whereas no visible signal of CaM2 could be observed in the flagella fraction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). In addition, IIF assay showed that CaM2 is scattered all over the cell body in a spotted pattern, but a weak signal was also visible in the flagellum (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b,c</xref>). To validate the specificity of the signal, a CaM2 knockdown mutant cell culture of <italic>E. gracilis</italic> was generated. In both wild type and knockdown mutant cells, the signal appeared as spots (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). However, quantitative analysis revealed that the number of spots decreased significantly in the knockdown mutant cells, which proved that the spotted pattern represented a specific signal (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c</xref>). Although CaMs are generally soluble proteins, CaM2 appeared as aggregated spots. To determine if CaM2 was a cytoplasmic protein, a GST-CaM2 fusion protein was generated and expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The soluble fraction of the prepared crude protein lysate GST-CaM2 transformed cells of <italic>E. coli</italic> was used, and the fusion protein was purified. The expression of GST-CaM2 from the soluble fraction of the cell lysate indicates that GST-CaM2 is expressed as a soluble protein in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CaM2 resides in the cell body of <italic>E. gracilis</italic>.

Four clones identified in the screen were positive in the retransformation assay. Among them, a protein containing the domain of unknown function (DUF) 4201 was found and named EgPCDUF4201. The 5&#x02032;and 3&#x02032; RACE PCR was performed to obtain the full length cDNA sequence of <italic>EgPCDUF4201</italic>. The obtained full length cDNA sequence of <italic>EgPCDUF4201</italic> encoded a protein of 372 amino acids. An <italic>in silico</italic> analysis run to identify potential additional conserved domains showed that, in addition to the DUF4201 domain, 5 coiled-coil domains, a predicted IQ motif (104&#x02013;123 residues) and a putative calmodulin binding site (202&#x02013;221 residues) were present (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>).

The down-regulation of the gene was confirmed by real time PCR (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>).

The current study provides a detailed account regarding the subcellular localization of CaM2 and identifies a new factor implicated in the gravitaxis.</p><p id="Par14">The cell fractionation study indicated that CaM2 resides in the cell body of <italic>E. gracilis</italic> but no signal could be detected on the flagella fraction. However, the IIF assays indicated that CaM2 is abundantly present in the cell body, and in a weak extend also in the flagella. Furthermore, both endogenous and heterologous CaM2 proteins (GST-CaM2) were detected in the soluble fraction of the cell lysate. However, IIF assay shows that the protein aggregates and appears as spots. Similar pattern has also been reported for other soluble proteins. For instance, in neuronal cells, a CaM dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was shown to self-aggregate near the endoplasmic reticulum under certain stress conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, in <italic>E. gracilis</italic> as in neuronal cells, a cellular stress before cell fixation can result in CaM2 aggregation in the cell body. Moreover, it has been recently shown that at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> level, which can be caused by cellular stresses, CaMs are bunched in well-defined regions, suggesting their association with cellular complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. On the contrary, at low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, CaMs are very motile proteins that are quickly available to propagate signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Even if the fixation could have slightly altered the CaM2 localization, CaM2 was detected all around the cell body, which is in accordance with the current working model of gravitaxis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Indeed, the calcium ions coming from the influx caused by the activation of SSCIC binds to CaM2. CaM2 being one of the primary actors of the signalization chain, it has to be quickly accessible at every sides of the cell, since the calcium influx could arise at any part of the plasma membrane, depending of the direction of the swimming deviation.</p><p id="Par15">The cells deviating from their upward swimming pattern have to be reoriented in order to stay in the best suitable place in the water column. This reorientation is achieved by a change in the beating of the flagella. Very interestingly, we identified a newly putative interaction partner of CaM2, EgPCDUF4201, localized in the flagella. The interaction occurred specifically with the C-terminus of the protein which contains the DUF4201. One part of this domain possesses also a putative calmodulin binding site, suggesting that the interaction could occur more specifically on this portion of the protein and further strengthens the results of the yeast two-hybrid. The IIF revealed that EgPCDUF4201 is distributed following a spotted pattern all along the flagellum, including at the base. We suggest that this protein is an intermediate factor between CaM2 and the dynein proteins which make the molecular motive force necessary for the flagella beat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">EgPCDUF4201 contains the DUF 4201. This domain is characterized as a coiled-coil domain and is present only in the ciliated and flagellated cells. The coiled-coil containing domain proteins are reported to function as skeletal proteins, motor proteins, pH-dependent coiled-coil switches and molecular recognition systems which make them a group of multifaceted proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. There are few reports regarding DUF4201 containing proteins. Notably, two DUF4201 containing proteins of <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, CCDC113 and CCDC96, are involved in cilia formation of sperm cells and have been reported to be localized in the centriolar satellites and centrosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. These structures are essential for the nucleation of the axonemes of the flagella. Although CCDC113 and CCDC96 share 30% and 38% similarity (amino acids) with EgPCDUF4201, respectively, their role is likely different from EgPCDUF4201. This latter is located in the flagella but is not implicated in their formation, as its down-regulation does not alter the flagella length.</p><p id="Par17">Interestingly, two homologues of EgPCDUF4201, termed flagella associated protein FAP 184 and FAP 263 are present in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and reported as phosphoproteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The bioinformatics analysis also predicted EgPCDUF4201 to be a phosphoprotein. Hence, it is plausible that post-translational modifications of EgPCDUF4201 through phosphorylation plays a role in the modulation of its function. Moreover, the current model of the gravity signal transduction chain of <italic>E. gracilis</italic> includes a kinase, PKA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. We can therefore speculate that PKA could phosphorylate EgPCDUF4201. In any case, it strengthens the fact that phosphorylation plays a role in the transduction chain of gravitaxis in <italic>E. gracilis</italic>.</p><p id="Par18">It has been shown previously, in micro- and hyper-gravity experiments, that the beating of the flagella was an active process controlled by gravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, but no specific flagellar protein playing a role in gravitaxis had yet been identified. The identification of EgPCDUF4201 brings thus a new major factor in the current working model, and is the first step to explain the change of the flagellar beat to reorient the cells. However, the mode of action of EgPCDUF4201 has still to be explored. Finding the interaction partners will help to understand if the protein acts on the beating of the flagella by interacting directly with the dyneins, or is only an intermediary actor of the signaling pathway leading to a proper beating pattern.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par19">The protein CaM2 previously identified as a member of the gravity signal transduction chain of <italic>E. gracilis</italic> is located in the cell body and in the flagella in a spotted pattern. Furthermore, CaM2 interacts with EgPCDUF4201 which is localized in the flagellum. The down regulation of the protein leads to an impaired gravitaxis. Thus, the study demonstrated the role of a novel protein in the gravity signal transduction chain in <italic>E. gracilis</italic>. This novel protein presents homologues in the other organisms possessing cilia or flagella, but their functions are still largely unknown and most likely not related to gravitaxis only.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Cell culture and growth conditions</title><p id="Par20">The experimental organism<italic>, Euglena gracilis</italic> KLEBS, strain Z, was obtained from the algal culture collection at the University of G&#x000f6;ttingen, Germany<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.
