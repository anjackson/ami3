The cell wall forms the central load bearing support structure for plant design, yet a mechanistic understanding of its synthesis is incomplete. A key tool for studying the structure of cellulose polymorphs has been x-ray diffraction and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Relative crystallinity index (RCI) is based on the x-ray diffraction characteristics of two signature peaks and we used this technique to probe plant assembly, adaptation and acclimation. Confocal microscopy was used to visualize the dynamics of cellulose synthase in transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing a homozygous YFP::CESA6. Assembly: RCI values for stems and roots were indistinguishable but leaves had 23.4 and 21.6&#x00025; lower RCI than stems and roots respectively. Adaptation: over 3-fold variability in RCI was apparent in leaves from 35 plant species spanning Ordovician to Cretaceous periods. Within this study, RCI correlated positively with leaf geometric constraints and with mass per unit area, suggestive of allometry. Acclimation: biomass crystallinity was found to decrease under conditions of thigmomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis. Further, in etiolated pea hypocotyls, RCI values also decreased compared to plants that were grown in light, consistent with alterations in FTIR cellulose fingerprint peaks and live cell imaging experiments revealing rapid orientation of the YFP::cellulose synthase-6 array in response to light. Herein, results and technical challenges associated with the structure of the cell wall that gives rise to sample crystallinity are presented and examined with respect to adaptation, acclimation and assembly in ecosystem-level processes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Structural and morphological diversity is a striking feature of land plants. Lignin and a group of carbohydrate polymers (pectin, hemicelluloses and cellulose) form the scaffolding of the cell wall, which in turn are the building blocks for cell shape and morphogensis <xref rid="pone.0002897-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The crystalline nature of cellulose has been one of the central problems studied by polymer scientists. Cellulose microfibrils are the main structural component of plant cell walls and are formed of <xref rid="pone.0002897-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002897-Gomez1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> linked b-D-glucosyl residues that are alternatively rotated by 180&#x000b0; along the polymer axis to form ribbon-like chains <xref rid="pone.0002897-Hermans1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. It has been established that each glucosyl residue has three hydroxyl groups, one of which is a hydroxymethyl group. The tight bonding capacity of the hydroxyl groups via hydrogen bonding are critical to determining how the crystal structure of cellulose forms and also in directing important physical properties of cellulose materials <xref rid="pone.0002897-Nishiyama1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The chains of glucosyl residues in the fibril periodically fail to coalesce into an ordered crystalline structure; these amorphous zones along the fibril length are recognized as possibly serving the association between hemicellulose and cellulose fibrils <xref rid="pone.0002897-Gomez1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In elongating plant tissue, cellulose deposition is generally considered to occur perpendicular to the axis of elongation, constraining lateral swelling (due to internal turgor pressure) and allowing longitudinal or anisotropic cell expansion <xref rid="pone.0002897-Mutwil1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. A surprising gap in our understanding concerns fibril length and what controls it, with current estimates ranging from 300 to 15,000 glucan units <xref rid="pone.0002897-Brett1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Another unresolved question regarding cellulose biosynthesis is whether cellulose fibril orientation, length or crystallinity may provide differential biomechanical properties to certain cell and tissue types and how this may correspond to a specific ecological niche?</p><p>Study of the overall variation in plant function have largely focused on traits such as foliar stoichiometry <xref rid="pone.0002897-Vitousek1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, specific leaf area <xref rid="pone.0002897-Niklas1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, seed and seedling characteristics <xref rid="pone.0002897-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, leaf area/dry mass (specific leaf area)<xref rid="pone.0002897-Vile1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, wood specific gravity <xref rid="pone.0002897-Woodcock1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, stem diameter <xref rid="pone.0002897-Niklas1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and the relationship between stem and branch wood specific gravity <xref rid="pone.0002897-Swenson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This building number of key functional traits is aimed at providing botanists with the ability to characterize the differential body plan and biomass allocation of plants with respect to their ecological niche <xref rid="pone.0002897-Graham1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Do plants adapt to environmental stimuli by regulating the density, orientation and/or biomechanical properties of cellulose fibrils in differentiated tissues? Recent studies of cellulose biosynthesis have shown that the upper hypocotyls of dark grown Arabidopsis seedlings expressing a functional YFP tagged cellulose synthase6 (CESA) have a transverse oriented CESA array. Yet, when this array is exposed to light the array rapidly changes (within 20 min) to a longitudinal array <xref rid="pone.0002897-Paredez1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> suggesting that elongating plants that are searching for light are very rapidly able to alter the biomechanics of their cellulose array. The orientation of CESA motility <xref rid="pone.0002897-Paredez1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002897-DeBolt1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> appears to be guided by underlying cortical microtubules. Moreover, the site of CESA insertion at the plasma membrane occurs in a non-random pattern suggestive of regulation <xref rid="pone.0002897-DeBolt2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. It has recently been found that the plant may have a cell wall sensing mechanism, <italic>THESEUS1,</italic> to provide transcriptional feedback on the integrity of the cell wall <xref rid="pone.0002897-Hmaty1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Recent discoveries at the cellular level suggest much is to be learnt about the regulation and plasticity of cellulose synthesis and its contribution to morphogenesis. The necessary body plan and biomass allocation properties of plants that proliferate under certain selection pressures such as growing at a rainforest floor have been found to differ dramatically from those that adapted to the upper canopy environment <xref rid="pone.0002897-Wright2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Land plant ecology on the basis of functional traits would thus suggest that plants adapt their biomechanical structure <xref rid="pone.0002897-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002897-Read1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>; this hypothesis was to be addressed in the current study with respect to the structure of cellulose.</p><p>Experiments described herein were designed to determine whether relative crystallinity of plant biomass samples was capable of responding to environmental cues. A central tool for polymer scientists studying the structure of cellulose polymorphs has become x-ray diffraction <xref rid="pone.0002897-Segal1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002897-Weimer1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, which has been shown to reflect the degree of polymerization <xref rid="pone.0002897-Puri1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> as well as structure <xref rid="pone.0002897-Andersson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002897-Teeaar1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Adopting published methods for the calculation of a relative crystallinity index (RCI, 22) as well as results gathered using synthetic cellulose (Simacell, 22 or Avicel, 27), RCI was determined using x-ray diffraction (XRD) in various plant samples. RCI determination can be influenced by the preferred orientation of cellulose crystallites in a sample <xref rid="pone.0002897-Andersson3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> or the size and surface area of the cellulose crystallites <xref rid="pone.0002897-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Hence it is important to note that the RCI parameter is relative to the portion of crystalline cellulose in the sample, thus defined as crystallinity of the sample rather than absolute crystallinity of the cellulose itself. Problems in crystallinity determination for wood samples from Norway spruce and Scots pine by transmission x-ray diffraction suggest that cellulose properties of size, orientation and crystalline:amorphous ratios are important considerations when assessing diffractogram differences <xref rid="pone.0002897-Andersson3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Plant response to abiotic physical stresses such as wind was assessed by RCI and in more detail etiolation was assessed by x-ray diffraction, YFP::CESA6 experiments and FTIR analysis. RCI was measured in a study of 35 diverse plant species, spanning liverworts to several C4 grasses. The RCI values of root, shoot and leaf were compared to assess differences among plant assembly components. Finally, these results are discussed with respect to technical challenges and ecological and biomechanical context.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Determining crystallinity index for plant biomass</title><p>Previous methods for estimating the crystallinity of cellulose <xref rid="pone.0002897-Segal1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002897-Teeaar1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> were adapted to plant biomass samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002897-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods and Materials</xref>).

However, this value does not take into account the possibility that texture of the sample influences RCI. It was found to be extremely challenging to use the leaf and non-woody biomass samples for the analysis of transmission geometries. Most technically challenging was mounting the sample, x-ray penetration through the sample and orientation of the fiber axis (some of which is random in leaf cells). Our attempts centered on the use of pressed potassium bromide (KBr) into a 7 mm diameter mold to create an opaque disk with the sample embedded, but maintaining any control over fiber orientation was not achieved. Also, the x-rays were not penetrating the disk well enough to provide enough intensity of the symmetrical transmission geometries (even at 110 and 200 A our peaks were very low intensity with rocking in the 110 A range required to create peak resolution). A lack of texture analysis in the samples by transmission geometries does not allow us to predict the preferred orientation of crystallites within the samples, nor the size or density of crystallites. Rather, RCI provides relative value for the reflective geometry of sample crystallinity.</p><fig id="pone-0002897-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002897.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>X-ray diffraction and plant ontogeny.</title><p>A) Synthetic crystalline cellulose (Avicel) displayed a diffractogram pattern consistent with diffractogram from plant biomass derived from Arabidopsis whole plant biomass (B) Schematic of the sample scan used to estimate the experimental accuracy of pressed biomass at 22.5&#x000b0; 2-theta.

Because the plant modified its body plan under dark growing conditions, this provided an opportunity to test whether RCI changed. Seven day old, dark-grown etiolated pea (<italic>Pisum sativum</italic>) seedlings displayed no pigmentation of hypocotyls and the tissue geometry and morphology were perpendicular to the growth media horizontal surface. Seedling heights were variable as demonstrated by the average height frequency graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002897-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). The average height of dark-grown seedlings (9.5&#x000b1;2.8 cm) was significantly greater than light-grown seedlings (3.7&#x000b1;1.2 cm P&#x0003c;0.001, Wilcoxan Ranked Signed Test).

Dark grown seedlings were exposed to a light source for 5 min and then reimaged 30 minutes later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002897-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Firstly, we confirmed orientation shift from within the range of 180&#x000b0;&#x000b1;20 to 90&#x000b0;&#x000b1;20 <xref rid="pone.0002897-Paredez1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Secondly, measurement of particle velocity of membrane bound YFP::CESA6 particles between transverse (dark) and longitudinal (light) oriented arrays were not significantly different (274 nm.min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b1;34 and 268 nm.min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b1;41, Wilcoxan Ranked Signed Test). Thirdly, average track lengths in the transverse array were 11.33&#x000b1;1.46 &#x000b5;m compared with 14.1&#x000b1;2.9 &#x000b5;m (P&#x0003e;0.05 ANOVA) for the longitudinal array. Maximum track lengths were 14.66 &#x000b5;m in the transverse array compared with 26.8 &#x000b5;m after exposure to the light in the longitudinal array. The combined length of a cellulose track in a given time consists of multiple particles in a 61 frame time lapse image. Fourth, the number of individual CESA puncta in a given track were compared by the calculation: CesA<sub>D</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;T<sub>L</sub>/P<sub>n</sub> where CESA<sub>D</sub> is CESA density along a track, T<sub>L</sub> is the track length over 61 frames (&#x000b5;m) and P<sub>n</sub> is the average particle number along that track. An average of 12.02&#x000b1;2.92 particles per strand (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;47 strands) were counted in transverse arrays compared with 13.36&#x000b1;4.30 particles per strand (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;47 strands) in longitudinal arrays (P&#x0003e;0.05, Wilcoxan Ranked Signed Test). Average CESA density (particles. &#x000b5;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) along a single track was lower in the transverse array (0.86&#x000b1;0.08 particles.&#x000b5;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) than the longitudinal array (1.05&#x000b1;0.13 particles. &#x000b5;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) but again not significantly lower (P&#x0003e;0.05, ANOVA).

RCI analysis was overlaid with plant species diversity, response to abiotic community boundaries and endemic plasticity. These combined data showed marked variability of relative sample crystallinity in plants across these ecological niches, but detailed quantitative determination of cellulose crystallite size, orientation and density of samples remained elusive.</p><p>Care must be taken when correlating the RCI index against plant samples. A series of detailed studies on the properties of wood cellulose have shown that RCI for pure cellulose samples is directly related to the cellulose crystallinity, but in plant samples that contain a matrix of amorphous polymers in addition to cellulose, the RCI represents the volume fraction of crystalline cellulose within the given sample <xref rid="pone.0002897-Puri1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002897-Sarn1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The central problem in interpreting the diffractograms by the RCI value is the preferred orientation of the crystallites (texture) contributing to change in RCI <xref rid="pone.0002897-Andersson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002897-Andersson3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Therefore, RCI values as measurement of the absolute crystallinity <italic>per se</italic> are comparable only if the samples have the same texture, which can be altered by orientation and size of crystallites <xref rid="pone.0002897-Puri1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002897-Sarn1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002897-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. It is postulated that even within the cell wall of a single cell, considerable variability in the cellulose length, orientation and absolute crystallinity may exist. Despite the problems with using x-ray diffraction to analyze plant materials <xref rid="pone.0002897-Andersson3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, determination of RCI has the capacity to distinguish changes in the volume fraction of cellulose as the crystallinity of a sample. Further, established covariance of any trait against the complexity of a biological system, in particular the relatively uncharted plant biomechanical system poses many challenges. Therefore, RCI was examined in three definable experimental categories; 1) comparison of leaves, stems and roots (assembly) 2) acclimation to abiotic stress in hypocotyls, stems and leaves and 3) adaptation of RCI in leaves of a diverse group of land plants. Are results for different samples comparable? Analysis of 12 different Arabidopsis sample replicates showed very high similarity of RCI between replicates (approx 2&#x00025;, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002897-t001">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, upon examination of grasses, several wild grown Switchgrass species were analyzed from different sites and growing seasons and were not significantly different from the previous analysis. However, when defining RCI, we cannot guarantee that samples are comparable other than the determined RCI parameter is related to proportional of crystalline cellulose in the foliar sample.</p><p>Within the body plan of a single plant (Arabidopsis) there was significant variability in RCI values between the roots or stems and rosettes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002897-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>), but not between roots and stems, suggestive of the different biomechanical architecture underlying ontogeny. For example, the RCI value was 23.4&#x00025; lower in rosettes than stems. Structural requirements and allocation of cellular energy into maximal photosynthetic surface area <xref rid="pone.0002897-Mandoli1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> in rosettes is greatly different from the requirements of rigidity and solute transport in the stem tissue <xref rid="pone.0002897-Ennos1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Keeping in mind that the RCI measure does not determine whether preferred orientation, size or absolute crystallinity were contributing to the lower RCI value of leaves, it is evident that RCI represents a much lower crystallinity of the leaf sample. The volume fraction of cellulose in these tissues followed a similar trend with 36&#x00025; lower cellulose content in leaves than stems.</p><p>When Arabidopsis plants were grown under conditions of constant wind (thigmomorphogensis) stems had lower RCI under high wind conditions than those grown without high wind stress (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002897-t001">Table 1</xref>). It is established that wind treatment results in decreased Young's modulus (stiffness of a material)<xref rid="pone.0002897-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, which infers a positive correlation between RCI and Young's modulus. Reports of the effect of wind on biomechanics suggest that plants are dwarfed due to investing a greater proportion of energy into mechanical reinforcement rather than surface area for photosynthesis <xref rid="pone.0002897-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002897-Read1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In stems, structural changes have been reported as producing &#x0201c;flexure fibers&#x0201d; or postulated high microfibrillar angle cellulose observed by Telewski <xref rid="pone.0002897-Telewski1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> under conditions of high wind to provide greater flexibility. But, crystallinity for compression wood has been shown to be lower than that of normal wood simply because the share of amorphous cell wall components is larger in compression wood and the difference in crystallinity between normal wood and compression wood is modest according to Newman <xref rid="pone.0002897-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>Experimental analysis of hypocotyls from dark grown pea plants showed that the RCI decreased compared with light grown hypocotyls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002897-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The biophysical nature of etiolated tissues was very different from light grown with more than double the average length of light grown hypocotyls (3.7 cm to 9.5 cm, P&#x0003c;0.001) and the cellulose synthase array oriented from transverse to longitudinal when dark grown seedlings were exposed to light (within 30 min, <xref rid="pone.0002897-Paredez1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002897-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Given the results of Yoshida et al. <xref rid="pone.0002897-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and Stubicar et al. <xref rid="pone.0002897-Stubicar1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, the lower RCI measured in dark grown hypocotyls may be achieved by reducing the physical length dimensions of cellulose fibrils. Or, given the experiments of Andersson et al. <xref rid="pone.0002897-Andersson3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> several factors associated with sample texture, including orientation, are likely to contribute. In attempting to use the leaf and non-woody biomass samples for the analysis of texture by transmission geometries, several technical challenges arose. Mounting the sample into a pressed KBr opaque disk with the sample embedded was achieved but maintaining any control over fiber orientation was not. Further, x-ray penetration through the sample was not sufficient for symmetrical transmission geometries (110 and 200A peaks were below measureable intensity). Alternatively, FTIR analysis of the light versus dark grown pea hypocotyls distinguished between the samples based on variance in the polysaccharide fingerprint region <xref rid="pone.0002897-Kacurakova1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Several spectral peaks in the variance plot were assigned to cellulose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002897-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). We attempted to investigate this hypothesis using live cell imaging to compare the orientation, velocity, track length, rosette number and density of YFP::CESA6 particles at cortex in dark (transverse) versus after light exposure (longitudinal) arrays. However, only array orientation was found to significantly differ among treatments <xref rid="pone.0002897-Paredez1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. It was evident that longer maximum trajectories of YFP::CESA6 particles could be traced after light exposure induced reorientation to a longitudinal array (14.4 &#x000b5;m in dark to 26.8 &#x000b5;m after light exposure), but the average track lengths were not significantly different due to the large range and an inability to track through the z-focal plane. Since each tracks was the sum of multiple particles (YFP puncta) we assessed the particle number per track and found that within the dark grown hypocotyl of Arabidopsis seedlings, regardless of dark growth or brief light exposure the YFP:CESA6 density were 0.86 and 1.05 particles per mm respectively. Given this density and their bidirectional velocity of approximately 270 nm.min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>

Also, a trend of increasing RCI with increasing LMA and leaf length was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002897-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>), which leans towards a possible allometric relationship <xref rid="pone.0002897-McCarthy1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Studies on the tensile properties of plants have shown that the grasses have 5&#x02013;10 times higher tensile strength than dicots for a given LMA, which suggests that the amount of fiber itself cannot account for the difference in tensile strength (Yusuke Onoda, Personal Communication). In addition to being central to plant cell shape and morphogenesis, cell walls and their biomechanical properties are thought to play a vital role in plant defense against both biotic and abiotic stress and hence have an integral role in functional plant ecology <xref rid="pone.0002897-Read1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Yet, plant biomechanics are poorly understood compared with other functional traits. Does RCI depend linearly on the crystallinity of the biomass sample? From the RCI value and experiments performed, it is arguable that the answer is no. Preferred orientation of the fibril array may in fact cause changes in the RCI consistent with finding of Andersson et al. <xref rid="pone.0002897-Andersson3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and YFP::CESA6 experiments as can the size of cellulose crystallites <xref rid="pone.0002897-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and ball milling experiments. It is noteworthy that the possibility of exploiting RCI as a trait may exist; in that lower RCI values of plant samples were far more readily turned into fermentable sugars <xref rid="pone.0002897-Weimer1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002897-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Therefore RCI may be part of the assessment strategy useful to breeders for selection of perennial grasses with more digestible properties for forage and biofuel production.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Chemicals</title><p>All chemicals and reagents used were of analytical grade or higher.
