In photosynthetic eukaryotes sulfate is reduced in the plastids whereas in aplastidic eukaryotes the pathway is cytosolic. The only known exception is <italic>Euglena gracilis</italic>, where the pathway is localized in mitochondria. To obtain an insight into the evolution of the sulfate assimilation pathway in eukaryotes and relationships of the differently compartmentalized isoforms we determined the locations of the pathway in lineages for which this was unknown and performed detailed phylogenetic analyses of three enzymes involved in sulfate reduction: ATP sulfurylase (ATPS), adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate reductase (APR) and sulfite reductase (SiR).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The inheritance of ATPS, APR and the related 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate reductase (PAPR) are remarkable, with multiple origins in the lineages that comprise the opisthokonts, different isoforms in chlorophytes and streptophytes, gene fusions with other enzymes of the pathway, evidence a eukaryote to prokaryote lateral gene transfer, changes in substrate specificity and two reversals of cellular location of host- and endosymbiont-originating enzymes. We also found that the ATPS and APR active in the mitochondria of <italic>Euglena </italic>were inherited from its secondary, green algal plastid.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results reveal a complex history for the enzymes of the sulfate assimilation pathway. Whilst they shed light on the origin of some characterised novelties, such as a recently described novel isoform of APR from Bryophytes and the origin of the pathway active in the mitochondria of Euglenids, the many distinct and novel isoforms identified here represent an excellent resource for detailed biochemical studies of the enzyme structure/function relationships.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Sulfur is found in all organisms as a constituent of the proteogenic amino acids cysteine and methionine and in many coenzymes and other metabolites. In most of these compounds sulfur is present in a reduced form of organic thiols or sulfides. The major form of sulfur in nature, however, is inorganic sulfate. Sulfate is taken up into cells, reduced, and incorporated into cysteine in the pathway of sulfate assimilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Since sulfate is a stable molecule, for reduction it must be activated. The adenylation to adenosine 5'phosphosulfate (APS) is catalyzed by ATPS. Plant ATPS is a homotetramer of 52&#x02013;54 kDa polypeptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Bacterial ATPS, on the other hand, consists of four heterodimers composed from 35 kDa CysD and 53 kDa CysN subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Some organisms, such as fungi and many bacteria, require a second activation step, i.e. phosphorylation of APS by APS kinase to 3'phosphoadenosine 5'phosphosulfate (PAPS). In fungi, ATPS and APS kinase are fused into a single 59 to 64 kDa subunit that assemble into a homohexamer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The reduction of activated sulfate consists of two steps. First, APS or PAPS is reduced to sulfite by APR or PAPS reductase (PAPR). APR exists as a homodimer in prokaryotes and it is fused to thioredoxin in plants and green algae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Most APRs contain an FeS cluster, however a variant of the enzyme from early branching streptophyte lineages (bryophytes and lycopodiophytes) has been shown to catalyze APS reduction without the FeS chemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. PAPR is similar to bacterial APR but does not bind the FeS cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In the second step, sulfite is reduced to sulfide by sulfite reductase (SiR). Plant SiR is a monomeric protein of 65 kDa containing a siroheme and an FeS cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In contrast, the bacterial NADPH-SiR is an oligomer of eight 66 kDa flavoprotein subunits (CysJ) and four 64 kDa siroheme and [4Fe-4S] cluster binding hemoproteins (CysI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. SiRs in fungi are composed from &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits of 116 kDa and 167 kDa respectively. Similar to bacterial SiR, the fungal enzyme requires siroheme, FAD and FMN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Sulfide is incorporated into the amino acid skeleton of <italic>O</italic>-acetylserine (OAS) or <italic>O</italic>-acetylhomoserine in fungi, to form cysteine or homocysteine, respectively, in a reaction catalyzed by <italic>O</italic>-acetyl(homo)serine-(thiol)lyase (OASTL). OAS itself is synthesized by acetylation of serine by serine acetyltransferase.</p><p>Although sulfate assimilation is essential for the incorporation of reduced sulfur into bioorganic compounds, the pathway seems to be readily dispensable when the lifestyle of the organism allows. It is absent in all metazoans, which satisfy their need for reduced sulfur by the ingestion of proteins to obtain the sulfur containing amino acids cysteine and methionine. Bacterial and protistan parasites also lack a sulfate assimilation pathway. In bacterial species that have undergone a significant genome reduction, the sulfate assimilation operon is almost invariably lost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This is enabled by the adaptation of the nutrition of these parasites for metabolites provided by the host. A third group of organisms usually lacking sulfate assimilation are Archaea and bacteria using dissimilatory sulfide (or thiosulfate) oxidation or sulfate reduction for respiration and energy conversion. The habitats of such organisms always contain sulfide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], therefore, there is no need for sulfate assimilation to sustain cysteine biosynthesis. The enzymes of the dissimilatory pathway, despite catalyzing the same chemical reaction, are either highly divergent (ATPS) or entirely unrelated (APR and SiR) to those of the sulfate assimilation pathway.</p><p>In plants, OAS and cysteine are synthesized in all three compartments capable of protein synthesis, i.e. cytosol, plastid, and mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Sulfate activation, however, takes place in the cytosol and plastids, whereas sulfate reduction is confined to plastids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Since sulfite reductase utilizes ferredoxin as an electron donor, the association of sulfate reduction with photosynthesis and plastids might be general for all photosynthetic eukaryotes. However, there is a remarkable exception, the photosynthetic flagellate <italic>Euglena gracilis</italic>, in which activity of enzymes involved in sulfate reduction and cysteine synthesis have been identified in the mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Experiments with purified mitochondria with the outer membrane removed, found that assay products accumulated largely in the medium indicating that in <italic>Euglena </italic>ATPS, APR, and SiR seem to be located in a sulfate metabolizing centre on the outside of the mitochondrial inner membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>This high variability in the components and locations of sulfate assimilation in eukaryotic lineages provokes the question of the origin of the pathway, especially plastid-containing lineages, which generally reduce sulfate in that organelle. Here we present the results of detailed phylogenetic analyses of each of enzymes that constitute the pathway. In addition we address the sub-cellular localization of the pathway, with a special focus on the secondary-plastid containing genus, <italic>Euglena</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Eukaryotic lineages reduce sulfate in one of three cellular compartments</title><p>An investigation of the complete genomes of many eukaryotic species and several others from which extensive expressed sequence tag data has been generated revealed genes for the sulfate assimilation enzymes ATPS, APR/PAPR, and SiR in all eukaryotes with photosynthetic plastids as well as fungi, <italic>Phytopthora </italic>spp. and the choanozoan, <italic>Monosiga brevicollis </italic>(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In the metazoans, the mycetozoan <italic>Dictyostelium discodium </italic>and the parasitic alveolate <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, the genes for the reductive part of the pathway are missing, however ATPS and APS kinase are still present. These species do not reduce sulfate but receive cysteine in their nutrition or produce it by transsulfuration of methionine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The sulfate activation enzymes are, however, essential for the synthesis of PAPS, which is the form of activated sulfate required for sulfation reactions. Sulfation of proteins and polysaccharides is a widespread modification. Hence, ATPS and APS kinase are ubiquitous among eukaryotes and in some lineages are fused together into the PAPS synthetase protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Numbers of isoforms and cellular locations of ATPS, APSK, APR, PAPR and SiR.

The exceptions are metazoan PAPS synthetases that have been localized both to cytosol and the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Consistent with biochemical data (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]), in species with primary photosynthetic plastids almost all sulfate-reducing enzymes show clear plastid-targeting pre-sequences at the N' terminus as indicated by an N terminal extension (compared to bacterial homologues) and amino acid composition consistent with a plastid transit peptide for each species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The exceptions are isoforms of ATPS and APS kinase from a few plant and red algal species lacking any N' -terminal targeting information and are thus predicted to be cytosolic. These enzymes are probably involved in the production of PAPS for sulfation reactions as in other eukaryotes. Experimental evidence from Arabidopsis and other plant species supports this, with ATPS activity being identified in the plastids and the cytosol but APR activity only found in the plastid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Only one of the four isoforms, however, was identified in a proteomic study of the plastid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Anomalously, all four ATPS isoforms identified from Arabidopsis have N' terminal extensions typical of plastid transit peptides.</p><p>In contrast to plants, no biochemical data for the pathway's localization exists for algae. The plastid transit peptides of green algae, especially, are shorter than average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and prediction software cannot distinguish plastid and mitochondrial targeting pre-sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Therefore, we addressed the localization of sulfate assimilation in the green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii </italic>by immuno-transmission electron microscopy. In Western blot analysis, antisera against Arabidopsis APR and SiR recognized single protein bands of 50 and 75 kDa, respectively, in <italic>C. reinhardtii </italic>protein extracts (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Signals from both antibodies were found to be almost exclusively within the plastid, indicating that the plastid is the site of sulfate reduction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Surprisingly, the signal was not distributed evenly within this compartment and instead was concentrated around the starch sheath, in close association with the pyrenoid (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Interestingly, in the bryophyte <italic>P. patens</italic>, localization of APR by immuno-fluorescence of a GFP fusion protein also revealed an uneven distribution of the protein in the plastid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The close co-localization of the two enzymes in <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>indicates that the enzymes of sulfate activation and reduction may form a multienzyme complex similar to that of serine acetyltransferase and OASTL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>TEM micrographs of immunogold labeling of <italic>C. reinhardtii </italic>using antisera against APR (1:2500) (A and B) and SiR (1:500) (C and D)</bold>.

The subcellular localization tools, TargetP and iPSORT, also suggested a mitochondrial location for these proteins.

This, and the fact that no other bacteria are found at the base of the clade but instead in a sisterhood to an ambiguous group containing cyanobacteria and eukaryotes, makes it uncertain if ATPS is of mitochondrial (&#x003b1;-proteobacterial) origin in these eukaryotes or if a lateral gene transfer has taken place at a later date.</p><p>Two other Opisthokont lineages, metazoans and the choanozoan <italic>M. brevicolis</italic>, encode an ATPS only distantly related to the fungal one. This isoform is most related to those found in plants and stramenopiles and is fused at the N' terminus to APS kinase. The fusion of ATPS and APS kinase is very common, occurring also in fungi where the APS kinase domain is attached to C terminus of ATPS; however, in fungi the function of the APS kinase domain is regulatory rather than catalytic. The most likely explanation is that ATPS and APS kinase were fused in the ancestral eukaryotes, as supported by the existence of this fused protein in diverse lineages (metazoans, choanozoans, and stramenopiles). The gene must then have split in red algae and plants. If the enzyme found in fungi, <italic>D. discoidum </italic>and <italic>T. gondii </italic>is of &#x003b1;-proteobacterial origin then the ancestor of these groups and those that encode the fusion protein would have contained both isoforms and losses would have occurred multiple times in various lineages.</p><p>Unexpectedly, fusions of ATPS with another enzyme were revealed in the stramenopiles <italic>Thalassiosira pseudonana</italic>, <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic>, and <italic>Phytophthora sojae </italic>and the haptophytes <italic>Pavlova lutheri </italic>and <italic>Emiliania huxleyi</italic>. In these organisms ATPS is fused to inorganic pyrophosphatase. The hydrolysis of pyrophosphate is an efficient mechanism to shift the very unfavorable equilibrium of ATPS reaction to the site of the products. Indeed, for enzymatic synthesis of APS the ATPS is coupled to pyrophosphatase to increase yields of the product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Even more intriguing is a fusion protein of ATPS found in <italic>Heterocapsa triquetra</italic>. Here, ATPS is fused to APR. This fusion most probably ensures a rapid channelling of APS to the site of its reduction, increasing the rate of sulfite production. Existence of this fusion supports the hypothesis that the enzymes of sulfate assimilation may form a multi-enzyme complex as recent experiments in onion suggest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>As discussed before, plastidial ATPS isoforms from streptophytes resolved in a clade that contained only eukaryotes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

Instead, the chlorophytes encoded ATPSs are robustly related to isoforms found in algae with secondary plastids and to certain cyanobacteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence for a eukaryote to cyanobacteria lateral gene transfer</title><p>Association of plant and algal genes with cyanobacteria usually indicates a cyanobacterial endosymbiont (plastidial) origin, however, in the case of ATPS, this is unlikely for several reasons. Firstly, since primary plastids were likely acquired only once [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] this cyanobacterial enzyme would have been lost twice, independently, in red algae and in streptophytes, while chlorophytes must have lost the host isoform after the divergence of streptophytes. Secondly, the cyanobacteria in this clade do not branch at the base but are strongly supported as sisters to chlorophytes to the exclusion of other algae. Only two genera of marine cyanobacteria are represented in this clade: <italic>Prochlorococcus </italic>and <italic>Synechococcus</italic>, the other cyanobacteria being found elsewhere in the tree. Intriguingly, the same two genera were found to have obtained a fructose 1,6 bisphosphate aldolase from a red alga [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Thirdly, the clade also contains chromist algal species (haptophytes and stramenopiles) and dinoflagellates. These latter groups contain secondary plastids of red-algal origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] but the red algae are not present in this clade, meaning that inheritance through their plastids is unlikely.</p><p>The final piece of evidence against a cyanobacterial origin of the ATPS found in chlorophyte plastids is the sisterhood to the fungal and &#x003b1;-proteobacterial clade discussed above. It is not possible to state conclusively that the isoforms in the eukaryotes found in these clades are of prokaryotic origin. The tree, therefore, strongly suggests a lateral gene transfer of ATPS to these cyanobacteria, rather than cyanobacterial origin of this enzyme in plastids. However, if this is true, then the origin of ATPS in chlorophytes and algae with secondary plastids in unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Isoform retargeting of ATPS</title><p>In the red alga <italic>Cyanidioschyzon merolae</italic>, it appears that the different ATPS isoforms were subjected to a cellular targeting reversal. Two isoforms of ATPS were identified in the complete genome of this species. The first is quite distinct from that found in other lineages and related only to those encoded in other rhodophytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The origin of this cytosolic ATPS in red algae remains unsolved, although it is perhaps most likely a derived paralogue of the second isoform, which resolved within a clade containing only eukaryotes. Intriguingly, although clustering with metazoans, this isoform encodes an N terminal sequence with all the features of a red-lineage transit peptide including a full 'FVAP' motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. A similar phenomenon was observed in the diatom <italic>T. pseudonana</italic>, which also encodes two isoforms of ATPS. According to the currently predicted gene models, which manual examination could not fault, the first is fused at the N terminus to APS kinase and encodes an N terminal signal peptide, followed by a region with several features of a diatom transit peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The second <italic>T. pseudonana </italic>isoform contains no extraneous N-terminal sequence by comparison to bacterial isoforms and is thus predicted to be cytosolic.

This presumed cytosolic isoform is specifically related (100 maximum likelihood bootstraps) to another diatom (<italic>P. tricornutum</italic>) sequence, which does encode plastid-targeting pre-sequences and clusters with other plastid-targeted isoforms from a variety of algae, suggesting the targeting of the plastid and cytosolic isoforms were reversed in <italic>T. pseudonana</italic>.</p><p>This reversal of location of plastid and cytosolic isoforms must have occurred independently in <italic>C. merole </italic>and <italic>T. pseudonana </italic>and is highly unusual.</p></sec><sec><title>Isoforms of plastid-targeted APR that do not bind an FeS cofactor are of PAPR origin</title><p>The enzymes catalyzing reduction of activated sulfate to sulfite, APR and PAPR are relatively similar sharing approx. 20% amino acid identity and a common active center represented by the amino acid sequence K/R E C G L/I H [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Initially, sulfate reduction was proposed to be PAPS dependent as the first organisms in which the pathway has been resolved were PAPR containing <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Salmonella typhimurium </italic>and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. APS dependent assimilation of sulfate was, however, discovered in algae and plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and thus it was believed that presence of plastids is the distinction between APS and PAPS pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, recently APRs were identified in a wide range of bacteria and the APS dependent reduction seems to be prevalent. While all fungi analyzed to date reduce PAPS, in prokaryotes the enzyme is limited to some groups of &#x003b3;-proteobacteria, and cyanobacteria. The major difference between the two enzymes seemed to be the presence of [Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>] cluster ligated by two invariant Cys pairs in all known APRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, a novel isoform of the enzyme from the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>, lacking the cluster, has been shown to reduce APS rather than PAPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This isoform was named APR-B to distinguish it from the majority of isoforms (denoted APR), which do require the presence of [Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>]. It was identified in several other lower plant genera, such as <italic>Selaginella </italic>and <italic>Marchantia </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This demonstrates that whereas presence of the cluster is invariantly linked to use of APS as substrate, its absence is not a necessary determinant of PAPR. The recently sequenced genomes of several secondary algae and of the choanozoan <italic>M. brevicollis </italic>encode homologues of the APR-B isoform without the Cys pairs binding the FeS cluster.

As stated above, aplastidic eukaryotes appear to reduce PAPS supporting that this APS reducing enzyme is likely of endosymbiont (plastid) origin. However, the origin of this plastid-targeted isoform is only supported by a single cyanobacterial sequence (<italic>Nodularia</italic>). Cyanobacteria have been found to reduce either PAPS or APS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Interestingly, almost all cyanobacterial genomes sequenced to date encode a PAPR.

A fragment of a gene for APR from APS-reducing <italic>Plectonema </italic>has been cloned and sequenced and shown to branch at the base of the streptophyte APR clade in a previous, though restricted, analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], however the sequence was too short for inclusion in this analysis. Since the <italic>Nodularia </italic>sequence is found at the base of the archaeplastidial clade, it is still possible that the APR in this lineage was obtained from their primary cyanobacterial endosymbiont.</p><p>The APR-B enzymes found in <italic>P. patens </italic>and the two <italic>Selaginella </italic>species branched outside of the well-supported clade that includes APR from plants. They were instead strongly related (100 maximum likelihood bootstraps) to chromist and chlorarachniophyte algae with dinoflagellates and an additional stramenopile isoform branching with good support (74 maximum likelihood bootstraps) at the base. This clade is sister to a clade containing PAPRs, the relationship of all being moderately well-supported (82 maximum likelihood bootstraps). Despite the lack of the Cys pairs for binding an FeS cluster, all of the enzymes within this clade are most likely to reduce APS rather than PAPS because, firstly, this has been demonstrated in <italic>P. patens </italic>and <italic>S. lepidophylla </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], secondly, as mentioned above, high APR activity has been measured in the chromist algae and lastly, the fusion of <italic>H. triquetra </italic>enzyme with ATPS indicates channeling of APS to its active centre. Still, detailed biochemical analysis of these proteins is needed to answer the question of substrate specificity unequivocally.</p><p>Two possibilities to explain this distribution exist. Firstly, the cyanobacterial ancestor of primary plastids contained APR, whereas the host that engulfed it possessed PAPR. The PAPS dependent enzyme changed its substrate specificity to APS and was then lost independently, a minimum of four times in rhodophytes, chlorophytes (after the branching of streptophytes), streptophytes (after the branching of bryophytes and lycopodiophytes leaving only APR in spermophytes) and in the chromalveolates/rhizarians, which comprise the rest of the clade. The second, more parsimonious explanation is a lateral gene transfer at the base of streptophytes from an alga with a secondary plastid, and the subsequent loss after the divergence of lycopodiophytes. This transfer would have had to happen after the change of substrate specificity. Better sampling of early diverging streptophytes might help to distinguish these possibilities, however, the strongly supported position of the mosses between the dinoflagellates and chromist (and chlorarachniophyte) algae, most strongly supports the latter.</p><p>The isoform of APS-reductase found in the chlorarachniophyte by <italic>B. natans </italic>is specifically related to those from chromist algae.

Indeed, sulfate reduction activity in the mitochondria has been shown in this species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The phylogenetic position within the algal-plastid (including chlorophyte) clade, makes a plastid origin (and therefore subsequent retargeting to mitochondria) of the enzyme most likely. However, as discussed above, the origin of this isoform in green algae is unclear. A plastid origin for the APR encoded by <italic>E. gracilis </italic>is also supported, with the enzyme being related to that found in the Archaeplastidal lineage, although the relationship to chlorophytes is not specifically supported. The origin of the third enzyme in the pathway, SiR, however, could not be determined, but very it is likely it is to be different from the ATPS and APR. Plastid localized sulfite reductase is ferredoxin dependent, whereas in <italic>Euglena </italic>sulfite reduction does not require ferredoxin and is thus most probably NADPH dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The location of SiR in mitochondria suggests that the enzyme may be coupled to the unusual pyruvate:NADP<sup>+ </sup>oxidoreductase, an ancient enzyme involved in oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This would explain not only the localization of SiR but also the rationale for <italic>Euglena </italic>not retaining and retargeting the protein inherited from its secondary plastid.</p><p>Although the full genomic sequence of <italic>Euglena </italic>is lacking, we can surmise that after the secondary endosymbiosis and subsequent relocation of genetic material to the host, the enzymes for ATPS and APR were re-targeted to the mitochondria, rather than to the compartment that they were inherited from and, likely, replaced the host-encoded genes. Because of lack of information on related host cells, it is unknown if the host reduced sulfur in the mitochondria prior to this event. Regardless, the location of the pathway in this cellular compartment raises some interesting biochemical questions. This localization of sulfate reducing centre ensures an effective provision of reduced sulfur to the cytosol and mitochondria, as demonstrated by the incorporation of the label from [<sup>35</sup>S] to free cysteine and proteins, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, transport processes to import the reduced sulfur compounds to plastids are still necessary. This leads to the question does the mitochondrial location in Euglenids provide a more efficient ATP production and/or reducing capacity than it would in the plastid? And, if so, why? The answer may lie in understanding whether the mechanism of sulfate reduction in <italic>Euglena </italic>is the same as in other plastid containing eukaryotes. A detailed analysis of purified APR from <italic>Euglena </italic>revealed that the enzyme forms a reaction intermediate where sulfate from APS is covalently attached to a Cys residue of the protein, similar as in higher plant APR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].

An incomplete expressed sequence tag clone of APR from <italic>E. gracilis </italic>was sequenced to completion and deposited in GenBank under accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU131629">EU131629</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Alignments and phylogenetic analysis</title><p>Protein alignments were made using Clustal X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] and manually edited in MacClade (Sinauer, Mass. USA). All ambiguous sites of the alignments were removed from the dataset for phylogenetic analyses, otherwise the complete proteins were used for analysis. The final matrix size for APR and PAPR was 63 &#x000d7; 168; for ATPS it was 64 &#x000d7; 300; for SiR and NiR 62 &#x000d7; 387. The alignment data are provided in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>.</p><p>Protein maximum-likelihood analyses were performed using PhyML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] with the WAG model of amino acids substitution, proportion of variable rates estimated from the data, and nine categories of substitution rates. 100 bootstrap trees were calculated with PhyML, also with nine rates categories. Bayesian trees were estimated by MrBayes version 3.1c using the WAG model with among-site rate variation modelled by a four discrete rates approximation of a gamma distribution. Four independent chains with random starting trees were run for 1 000 000 generations, samples were taken every five hundredth generation and the first 200 sampled trees were discarded as burn-in.</p><p>For distance analyses, gamma-corrected distances were calculated by PUZZLE using the WAG substitution matrix with eight variable rate categories and invariable sites. Trees were inferred by weighted neighbor-joining using WEIGHBOR and FITCH. Bootstrap resampling was performed using PUZZLEBOOT with rates and frequencies estimated using PUZZLE. Both distance trees gave the same topologies at supported nodes as maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>APS &#x02013; adenosine 5'phosphosulfate; PAPS &#x02013; 3'phosphoadenosine 5'phosphosulfate; APR &#x02013; adenosine 5'phosphosulfate reductase; PAPR &#x02013; 3'phosphoadenosine 5'phosphosulfate reductase; ATPS &#x02013; ATP sulfurylase; SIR &#x02013; sulfite reductase; OAS &#x02013; <italic>O</italic>-acetylserine; OASTL &#x02013; <italic>O</italic>-acetyl(homo)serine-(thiol)lyase</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>NJP and SK conceived the study.
