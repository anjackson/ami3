In Arabidopsis the RLK family contains more than 600 members, constituting 60% of kinases, including almost all of the transmembrane kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The position of RLKs in the plasma membrane, with an extracellular receptor domain and an intracellular kinase domain, makes them well suited to the task of perceiving a signal external to the cell and conducting that signal into the cell in order to elicit a response. In addition to RLKs there are a number of receptor-like proteins (RLPs). These proteins contain an extracellular domain similar to a RLK but lack the intracellular kinase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Based on the criteria of extracellular domain structure and kinase domain phylogeny, RLKs are divided into subfamilies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The <italic>SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE </italic>(<italic>SERK) </italic>gene family belong to the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) subfamily of RLKs. These RLKs contain varying numbers of LRRs in their extracellular receptor domain. <italic>SERK </italic>genes belong to subgroup II (LRRII) and contain five LRR domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The family has been defined according to several factors. The first is the presence of 11 exons with conserved splicing boundaries and the tendency for each exon to encode a specific protein domain. Secondly the SERK amino acid sequence contains a particular order of domains from N to C-terminal: Signal peptide (SP), leucine zipper (ZIP), 5 LRRs, a proline-rich domain (SPP), transmembrane, kinase and C-terminal domains. The SPP domain, containing the SPP motif and the C-terminal domain are considered to be the characteristic domains of SERK proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Although this is largely correct for annotated <italic>SERK </italic>genes there is some divergence from the set criteria. The Arabidopsis <italic>NIK </italic>(<italic>NSP interacting kinase</italic>) genes share many similarities with <italic>SERK </italic>genes. <italic>NIK </italic>genes are so named because of their function in signalling during virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. They are described as interacting with the Nuclear Shuttle Protein (NSP) domain of the virus.</p><p>The first <italic>SERK </italic>genes identified were linked to competence of cultured cells to form somatic embryos in carrot (<italic>Daucus carota</italic>), orchard grass (<italic>Dactylis glomerata</italic>) and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Since that time <italic>SERK </italic>gene expression has been associated with somatic embryogenesis (SE) and organogenesis in numerous species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In Arabidopsis five <italic>SERK </italic>genes have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] (<italic>AtSERKs 1-5</italic>) and the gene functioning in SE is <italic>AtSERK1 </italic>(locus At1g71830). As understanding of the roles of the different members of the <italic>SERK </italic>gene family has increased, it has become apparent that these genes function in diverse signalling pathways with roles from development to defence. The Arabidopsis <italic>SERK </italic>gene family is subdivided into two subfamilies, generated from an ancestral gene duplication event. The first subfamily consists of <italic>AtSERKs 1 </italic>and <italic>2 </italic>(SERK1/2) and the second subfamily, <italic>AtSERKs 3</italic>, <italic>4 </italic>and <italic>5 </italic>(SERK3/4/5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>AtSERK1 is required in conjunction with AtSERK2 for anther development and male gametophyte maturation, with double mutants lacking a tapetal layer and failing to develop pollen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. AtSERK1 and AtSERK3 (also called BRI1-associated kinase1 (BAK1)) function in brassinosteroid (BR) signal transduction as components of the BR receptor complex, through dimerization with brassinosteroid-insensitive 1 (BRI1) kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Both AtSERK3 and AtSERK4 (also called BAK1-LIKE 1 (BKK1)) have been linked to programmed cell death, which can function in both developmental and pathogen defence roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. What has emerged from studies of Arabidopsis SERK signalling is that these genes have a tendency to be redundant in pairs with different pairs working in different pathways. Therefore single <italic>SERK </italic>gene mutants show weak or no phenotype as a second <italic>SERK </italic>gene can complement their function. Different combinations of <italic>SERK </italic>genes act in different pathways and these combinations vary according to the pathway. For instance, AtSERK1 and 2 can complement each other in anther development, where AtSERK3 is shown not to function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, AtSERK1 and 3 function together in BR signalling, and AtSERK3 and 4 are redundant in the programmed cell death pathway. So far a function for AtSERK5 is not known.</p><p>In defence responses, AtSERK3/BAK1 functions in pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity through heterodimerization with the Flagellin sensing 2 (FLS2) receptor kinase in response to binding by the bacterial PAMP, flagellin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A rice SERK, OsSERK1, shows activity in both somatic embryogenesis and fungal defence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The concept of a receptor functioning in both development and pathogen response pathways is reminiscent of the TOLL receptor of Drosophila, also an LRR protein, which is a controlling factor in both embryo development and immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Similarly ERECTA in Arabidopsis functions in inflorescence and fruit development as well as pathogen resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>The ability of AtSERKs to be essential to a number of diverse pathways, receptive to both peptide and steroid ligands, poses the question as to how these similar proteins can show such diversity of function. One possibility is that they are not the primary ligand-binding receptor protein, but instead dimerize with other RLK proteins that are specifically targeted to the one response pathway; for example, the BRI1 RLK in the case of BR signalling, or the FLS2 RLK in immune response to bacterial infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. There is also evidence that AtSERK proteins may function in the process of endocytosis of the active receptor complex following ligand binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>In the model legume <italic>M. truncatula </italic>we have studied <italic>MtSERK1 </italic>in relation to SE and other aspects of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] but no additional information is available in legumes on other members of the <italic>SERK </italic>family. Legume species comprise some of the world's essential crops for both human and animal nutrition, as a source of biofuels and are of ecological importance due to their ability to form symbiotic relationships with <italic>Rhizobium </italic>species and fix atmospheric nitrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In this study we have identified members of the <italic>SERK </italic>family in <italic>M. truncatula </italic>and soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>) and analysed their phylogeny in relation to development and defence. In the case of <italic>MtSERK3 </italic>a number of transcripts have been identified by PCR, consistent with the presence of splice variants, and this is discussed in relation to MtSERK3 function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>SERK </italic>genes identified in <italic>M. truncatula</italic></title><p>Using degenerate PCR from various tissues and database mining we identified eight putative <italic>SERK </italic>genes in <italic>M. truncatula</italic>, in addition to the already characterized <italic>MtSERK1 </italic>(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Degenerate PCR did not detect any <italic>SERK</italic>-like sequences that were not also found using database searches. Based on our analysis these genes were named <italic>MtSERK 2-6 </italic>and <italic>MtSERK-like 1-3 </italic>(<italic>MtSERKL 1-3</italic>). Five of the genes had one or two corresponding tentative consensus (TC) or EST sequences on the DFCI Medicago gene index (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/cgi-bin/tgi/gimain.pl?gudb=medicago">http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/cgi-bin/tgi/gimain.pl?gudb=medicago</ext-link>; shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) but none of these represented full length coding sequences. The remaining three genes (<italic>MtSERK3, MtSERK4 and MtSERK6</italic>) matched genomic DNA sequences but had no corresponding ESTs. Of the eight predicted genes, five (<italic>MtSERKs 2-6</italic>) occur in tandem over a 33 Kb region on chromosome 2 (genomic sequence from GenBank accession numbers <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AC195567">AC195567</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AC187356">AC187356</ext-link>). The other three occur on chromosomes 3, 5 and 8 (genomic sequences from GenBank accession numbers <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CT967306">CT967306</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CT025841">CT025841</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AC126784">AC126784</ext-link> repectively; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). PCR amplification of cDNA from various tissues and sequencing were used to obtain the full length coding sequence of each of the eight identified genes. For one of these genes, seven different cDNA sequences were amplified using nested PCR and sequenced. The presence of these different sequences is consistent with the presence of splice variants. Blastp searches of all of the predicted amino acid sequences of the putative <italic>SERK </italic>genes on the NCBI database <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link> showed <italic>MtSERKs 2-6 </italic>have high similarity to <italic>AtSERK3</italic>. The other three <italic>MtSERKL </italic>genes are similar to <italic>SERKs </italic>from various species, but in Arabidopsis, <italic>MtSERKL1 </italic>and <italic>MtSERKL2 </italic>are more similar to <italic>NIK </italic>genes.

of <italic>MtSERK3</italic>. Gene name refers to the final name given to each gene. The genomic identifier is the GenBank number of the genomic sequence containing each gene. Chr is chromosome number. TC/EST identified refers to any matching TC or EST sequence found on the DFCI Medicago gene index at the time the eight new genes were first identified. These numbers have since been updated and sometimes divided into separate sequences. Current TC number shows the current corresponding TC numbers for each sequence. No. of ESTs on DFCI is the number of ESTs used to compile each TC sequence on the DFCI Medicago gene index. Detected on degenerate PCR indicates which sequences we found using that technique. Matching probeset ID on MtGI indicates the corresponding probeset on the <italic>M. truncatula </italic>Gene Expression Atlas. Chr Pos is the gene position in kilobase pairs (Kbp) on each chromosome established from CViT blast searches. Gene loci indicates the gene locus number/s present at each site. Splice variant (SV) numbers of the 7 MtSERK3 SVs are given. GenBank numbers apply to full-length mRNA sequences deposited on the NCBI database. Length, molecular weight (MW) and pI values of predicted protein sequences are shown.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>In order to determine the chromosomal position of each gene genomic full-length coding sequences plus several hundred bases 5' and 3' of each gene were used for a CViT blast search of the <italic>M. truncatula </italic>pseudomolecule: MT3.0 database. Each of the Medicago <italic>SERK </italic>and <italic>SERKL </italic>genes, except for <italic>MtSERK1</italic>, showed 100% match to the database, and the position of these is shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. <italic>MtSERK1 </italic>is not present on this database, with its closest match corresponding to part of <italic>MtSERK2 </italic>sequence on chromosome 2.

All of the <italic>M. truncatula </italic>sequences except for MtSERK3 have a predicted signal peptide. MtSERK3 is predicted to be secreted in a non-classical manner. The consensus sequence of a leucine zipper Leu-X<sub>6</sub>-Leu-X<sub>6</sub>-Leu-X<sub>6</sub>-Leu, where X is any residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] is present in MtSERKs 1, 2, 5 and 6. It is absent in the remaining <italic>M. truncatula </italic>SERK-like proteins and is also absent in Arabidopsis SERKs 4 and 5 as well as the three Arabidopsis NIKs. All of these proteins have partial leucine zipper sequences, with the first Leu-X<sub>6</sub>-Leu sequence intact, but lack other conserved leucines and/or have extra residues between conserved leucines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The positions of the five SERK LRRs are indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. There is good alignment of the LRRs with the exception of LRR 5 in the three Medicago SERKL proteins. The SPP domain is not well conserved. The SERK-characteristic SPP motif, highlighted yellow in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> is not present in all SERK proteins with AtSERKs 4 and 5 lacking this motif. In <italic>M. truncatula </italic>the SPP motif is present in MtSERKs 1, 2, 4 and 5, but is lacking in the other proteins. The Medicago SERKL proteins show the least amount of homology in this domain. All of the <italic>M. truncatula </italic>sequences contain predicted transmembrane and kinase domains.

To identify other putative <italic>SERK </italic>and <italic>SERK</italic>-like genes in soybean, the mRNA sequences of the <italic>M. truncatula SERK </italic>and <italic>SERK</italic>-like genes were blasted against the genomic sequence of soybean. Fourteen more <italic>SERK-like </italic>genomic sequences were obtained, and from these mRNA and amino acid sequences were predicted.</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic analysis of legume <italic>SERK </italic>genes</title><p>A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the predicted amino acid sequences of the <italic>M.truncatula SERK </italic>and <italic>SERK</italic>-like genes, the three soybean <italic>SERK </italic>and <italic>NIK </italic>genes present in the database and the fourteen soybean genes predicted from the soybean genome sequence. Also included in the tree are all LRRII subgroup RLK-LRR genes from Arabidopsis and SERKs from the NCBI database representing full length AA sequences from a number of other plant species (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

MtSERKL1 and MtSERKL2 fall into a clade with the soybean and Arabidopsis NIKs. Sequences of four of the predicted soybean genes also fall in the NIK clade. One Medicago sequence, MtSERKL3, along with three Arabidopsis sequences and four of the predicted soybean sequences form a clade that is separate from the SERK and NIK clades (Labelled "Other" in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The four non-Arabidopsis, non-legume sequences that fall in the NIK clade (Pt1, Os1, PpSERK1 and PpSERK2 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) have been annotated as SERKs in the literature and/or on the NCBI database.

A search of the database revealed only one Lotus predicted gene similar to the Medicago SERK3/4/5 genes. This gene occurs on chromosome 6 (Genbank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AP006424">AP006424</ext-link>), which is syntenic to <italic>M. truncatula </italic>chromosome 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. This Lotus genomic DNA sequence showed sequence homology with all five Medicago SERK3/4/5 genes, with some sequence homology in introns and in 5' and 3' untranslated regions, as well as in exons. These results, combined with the fact that no other potential sequences were found in the Lotus genome, indicate that the single <italic>SERK </italic>gene region on Lotus chromosome 6 probably corresponds to the five <italic>SERK </italic>gene region on <italic>M. truncatula </italic>chromosome 2. These five <italic>SERK </italic>genes in Medicago may have duplicated since it diverged from Lotus. At this point it is unknown whether legumes closely related to Medicago also have replication of this <italic>SERK </italic>gene as there is as yet no sequence information. The intron sequences of the five replicated <italic>M. truncatula </italic>genes were used to estimate the times of duplication of these genes. It is estimated that duplication events occurred at 3.25, 3.05, 2.65 and 2.2 million years ago as indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>MtSERK3 </italic>transcripts</title><p>PCR analysis suggested a total of seven different transcripts consistent with seven splice variants of <italic>MtSERK3 </italic>. The differences observed between the splice variants is that they either include an intron or introns in their sequence and/or are missing exon 3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Introns that are included as exons are introns 5, 6 and 8, either alone or in combination. Each of these intron sequences introduces a stop codon thereby creating a truncated coding sequence. Splice variant (SV) 1 has the structure of a normal <italic>SERK </italic>gene, containing 11 exons. SV3 is also full length except it lacks exon 3, which encodes the first LRR. SV2 and SV4 retain intron 8, with SV4 also lacking exon 3. The remaining three splice variants lack exon 3 and retain intron 5 and its associated stop codon. SV5 and SV6 retain intron/s after intron 5, but the three SVs 5-7 encode the same protein sequence. Together the seven SVs encode five predicted proteins. Although five of the SV sequences contain stop codons in introns 5 or 8, the transcript continues through the remaining coding sections found in a typical <italic>SERK </italic>gene. In these sequences a second possible transcript occurs with a predicted start codon in exon 9 in the region encoding subdomain IV of the the kinase domain. This sequence continues through to the position of the stop codon in exon 11 of SV1 (usual SERK gene structure). This was confirmed by sequencing in SVs 4, 5, 6 and 7. In SV2, sequence data was not obtained for sequence corresponding to most of exon 10 and exon 11.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Representation of the seven splice variants (SVs) identified from the <italic>MtSERK3 </italic>gene</bold>.

Five members fall into the NIK clade and four are part of the clade, containing MtSERKL3, separate to SERK and NIK.</p><p>In evolutionary terms, the closest legume to <italic>M. truncatula </italic>that has <italic>SERK </italic>sequence information is Lotus. The divergence of Medicago and Lotus is estimated to have occurred around 50 million years ago, after the divergence of soybean from Medicago and Lotus around 54 million years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The predicted gene in Lotus which appears to be orthologous to the five SERK3/4/5 family member genes is a single copy gene, indicating that the Medicago genes may have duplicated after the divergence of Medicago and Lotus. We estimate the duplication of the Medicago genes occurred much more recently - from 3.25 to 2.2 million years ago. Phylogenetically there are two soybean genes that are equally closely related to these five Medicago SERKs (Gm08g19270 (Gm2) and Gm15g05730; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These genes occur on different chromosomes and would originate from duplication of the entire soybean genome rather that duplication of a single gene. However, duplication has occurred on a less closely related soybean SERK3/4/5 gene, with two genes occurring in tandem on chromosome 5 (Gm05g24770 and Gm05g24790; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). It appears that soybean had its own SERK3/4/5 family member duplication event after its divergence from Medicago and Lotus.</p><p>In the <italic>SERK </italic>and <italic>SERKL </italic>genes there is not a simple ratio of two soybean genes for every Medicago gene, as would be expected from simple duplication of the soybean genome. It may be that not all of the Medicago genes have been identified, especially those that are not in the SERK clade. On the other hand, there is the likelihood of genome changes in both of the species during the past 50 million years to produce the gene compliment that is identified. Full sequencing of the <italic>M. truncatula </italic>genome would be the only way to fully and conclusively elucidate the complement of these genes in <italic>M. truncatula</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>SERK </italic>and <italic>SERKL </italic>genes in relation to development and defence</title><p>We propose the similarities between <italic>SERK </italic>and <italic>NIK </italic>genes in both structure and function indicate that these gene families, as well as other closely related LRR-RLKs, form part of a larger gene superfamily that operates in signalling during plant development and defence. The families cannot be segregated based on developmental or defence function, with both families containing members in each type of role and some individual members operating in both pathways. For example, Os5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, SERK1/2 sub-family) has a dual role in somatic embryogenesis and defence against fungal pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], Os3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, SERK1/2 sub-family) is linked to fungal defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], so-called <italic>PpSERK1 </italic>and <italic>PpSERK2 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <italic>NIK </italic>family), act in the early defining stages of apomixis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Therefore it may be advantageous to consider the wider SERK/NIK gene superfamily, encompassing all LRRII subclass genes, when looking at <italic>SERK </italic>gene function in plants.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of Medicago <italic>SERKs </italic>during the induction of somatic embryogenesis in culture</title><p>Historically legumes have been difficult to transform and regenerate. The model legume, <italic>M. truncatula </italic>can be transformed and regenerated via somatic embryogenesis, but there is first a requirement for selection of an amenable genotype using tissue culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. A role for MtSERK1 during the establishment of embryogenic and organogenic cultures in <italic>M. truncatula </italic>was implied when it was shown that this gene is upregulated under these culture conditions. Expression of <italic>MtSERKs 3, 4, 5 </italic>and <italic>6 </italic>, like <italic>MtSERK1 </italic>is significantly upregulated in both 2HA and Jemalong cultured tissue in comparison to expression in the starting leaf tissue (week 0), whereas the expression of <italic>MtSERK2 </italic>remains constant throughout culture and in the starting leaf tissue. This variance in expression pattern suggests that MtSERK2 at least, functions differently to MtSERKs 3-6. <italic>MtSERK4 </italic>and <italic>MtSERK6 </italic>are the most highly upregulated <italic>SERKs </italic>in culture with both showing greater than 12 fold upregulation of expression in the first week of culture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The expression of the three Medicago <italic>SERKL </italic>genes stayed fairly constant in leaf tissue and in culture suggesting these genes are not part of the regulation of events in culture (data not shown).</p><p>Our intron analysis indicates that the <italic>MtSERK2 </italic>and <italic>MtSERK3 </italic>genes arose from the first duplication event, esimated to be 3.25 mya. This raises the possibility that any function dependent on upregulation of <italic>MtSERKs 3 - 6 </italic>in culture evolved after the first duplication event which may be of significance when comparing the embryogenic capacity of different legume species. It was also noted that the promoter sequences of the five replicated <italic>M. truncatula SERK 3/4/5 </italic>subfamily member genes show greater sequence divergence between the members than the intron sequences (data not shown). Such a rapid change in gene promoters also supports the theory of functional divergence of these genes. In <italic>M. truncatula SERK1 </italic>expression is associated with developmental change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. It seems likely that as in Arabidopsis, heterodimers involving SERK1 with other SERKs or other RLKs help to regulate legume development.</p></sec><sec><title>Splice variant</title><p>To our knowledge, the detection of sequences consistent with the existence of splice variants of <italic>MtSERK3 </italic>is a novel observation for a <italic>SERK </italic>gene. An understanding of AS in plants is in its early days, but it is estimated that AS occurs in about 20% of plant genes. What is known is the predominant form of AS in plants is in the form of intron retention comprising around 50% - 60% of AS events, with exon skipping comprising around 8%. This is quite different from the situation in humans where exon skipping is the predominant form of AS (58%) and intron retention comprises around 5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Using sequence data from ESTs an attempt has been made to identify alternatively spliced genes in Arabidopsis, rice and legumes and this information has been deposited on the ASIP (Alternative Splicing in Plants) database at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantgdb.org/ASIP/">http://www.plantgdb.org/ASIP/</ext-link>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. As <italic>MtSERK3 </italic>is one of the genes that had no corresponding ESTs on the database, it is not listed in the <italic>M. truncatula </italic>splice variants on the ASIP database. None of the five Arabidopsis <italic>SERK </italic>genes are listed as having splice variants. However, AS events are recorded in other LRR-RLKs, and in a separate study 34 alternatively spliced LRR-RLKs were identified in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. AS producing premature stop codons, such as SVs 2,4,5,6 and 7 of <italic>MtSERK3</italic>, may produce transcripts that are targets for non-sense mediated RNA decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. However, Ner-Gaon (2004) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] presented evidence that transcripts with retained introns are exported from the nucleus and are associated with ribosomal complexes thus supporting the view that they may be functional.</p><p>The seven splice variant sequences observed in <italic>MtSERK3 </italic>are predicted to code for five different proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), including SV1 that has a regular SERK-like structure. The structure of SV2 and SV4 gives these proteins structural similarity to the known RLPs such as CLAVATA2 (CLV2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The SVs 5, 6 and 7, encode a single severely truncated predicted protein which contains the N-terminal, lacking LRR1, with a stop codon introduced immediately after the position of LRR4 in a normal SERK gene. This leaves the first two exons, encoding the putative SP and ZIP domains, then three LRRs followed by a stop codon. We have no knowledge of reports of a similar truncated LRR-RLK in the literature and it is quite conceivable that such a protein is targeted for degradation. On the other hand there are other defence proteins that are encoded by alternatively spliced genes where it has been shown that AS of these genes is necessary to enable the defence function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. For example, the Arabidopsis <italic>RESISTANCE TO PSEUDOMONAS SYRINGAE4 </italic>(<italic>RPS4</italic>) gene belonging to the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-nucleotide binding site (NBS)-Leu-rich repeat (LRR) class of disease resistance (<italic>R</italic>) genes is alternatively spliced to give both full-length and truncated proteins, and the presence of all of these proteins is required for disease resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. In general there is a bias for alternatively spliced genes with intron retention in plants to function in defence and external/internal stimuli-related functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Additionally, in the mouse, members of the TOLL-like receptor signalling pathway show widespread alternative splicing, which is thought to allow a higher level of diversity in the inflammatory pathway in response to pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. The already established role for <italic>SERK </italic>genes in defence raises the possibility that some defence effect related to AS could be operating in <italic>MtSERK3</italic>. Of course such a role would need to be shown experimentally.</p><p>In keeping with a potential defence role, a recent study suggests that plant LRR-RLK genes can be grouped according to whether or not they have undergone gene expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. The authors propose that the expanded group share similarities with the NBS-LRR resistance genes in their genetic variation and evolution and are more likely to function in disease resistance, whereas the non-expanded group have a tendency to function in growth and development. The expansion of the five Medicago SERK3/4/5 family member genes from a single ancestor may imply a role in defence for one or more of them. This observation along with the similar gene splicing to that observed in TIR-NBS-LRR genes is supportive of a role for MtSERK3 in defence. The rice SERK1/2 family member gene, <italic>OsBISERK1</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] (Os3 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) is one example of a defence related gene belonging to the expanded group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].</p><p>MtSERK3 has other unusual features. One is its lack of a predicted signal peptide, although it is predicted to be secreted in a non-classical manner. The other is the truncation of the C-terminal domain in comparison to other SERK proteins. The actual function of the SERK C-terminal domain is unknown, but one possibility is a role in protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The distinct characteristics of MtSERK3 may indicate a rapid evolution of different function after the gene duplication events which had created five genes from a single ancestral gene. The creation of extra gene copies relaxed selective pressure allowing some copies to evolve new functions, while at least one of the genes maintained the original function. However <italic>MtSERK3 </italic>is still upregulated in tissue culture which also implies a developmental role during early culture events similar to that of <italic>MtSERK1 </italic>and to other SERKs that were first described in relation to SE.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study we have identified and sequenced the mRNAs of five more <italic>SERK </italic>and three <italic>SERK-like </italic>genes in <italic>M. truncatula</italic>, and used these sequences to identify homologous genes in soybean.

The gene duplication event and the presence of splice variants may be indicative of a role in defence, similar to that observed in NBS-LRR genes.
