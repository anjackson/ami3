Although various attempts have been made to explain why such a seemingly inefficient genetic mechanism would have evolved, no satisfactory explanation exists in our view. In this study, we examined editing patterns in chloroplast genomes of the hornwort <italic>Anthoceros formosae </italic>and the fern <italic>Adiantum capillus-veneris </italic>and in mitochondrial genomes of the angiosperms <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic>Beta vulgaris </italic>and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>, to gain an understanding of the question of how RNA editing originated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that 1) most editing sites were distributed at the 2<sup>nd </sup>and 1<sup>st </sup>codon positions, 2) editing affected codons that resulted in larger hydrophobicity and molecular size changes much more frequently than those with little change involved, 3) editing uniformly increased protein hydrophobicity, 4) editing occurred more frequently in ancestrally T-rich sequences, which were more abundant in genes encoding membrane-bound proteins with many hydrophobic amino acids than in genes encoding soluble proteins, and 5) editing occurred most often in genes found to be under strong selective constraint.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These analyses show that editing mostly affects functionally important and evolutionarily conserved codon positions, codons and genes encoding membrane-bound proteins. In particular, abundance of RNA editing in plant organellar genomes may be associated with disproportionately large percentages of genes in these two genomes that encode membrane-bound proteins, which are rich in hydrophobic amino acids and selectively constrained. These data support a hypothesis that natural selection imposed by protein functional constraints has contributed to selective fixation of certain editing sites and maintenance of the editing activity in plant organelles over a period of more than four hundred millions years. The retention of genes encoding RNA editing activity may be driven by forces that shape nucleotide composition equilibrium in two organellar genomes of these plants. Nevertheless, the causes of lineage-specific occurrence of a large portion of RNA editing sites remain to be determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Reviewers</title><p>This article was reviewed by Michael Gray (nominated by Laurence Hurst), Kirsten Krause (nominated by Martin Lercher), and Jeffery Mower (nominated by David Ardell).</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>RNA editing refers to the general phenomenon of post-transcriptional modification of gene transcripts, including insertion, deletion and substitution of nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In plants, substitution types of RNA editing, mostly C to U but occasionally U to C, have been observed in both chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of all major lineages of land plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have shown genome-wide occurrence of RNA editing in both chloroplasts and mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], restoration of conserved amino acids by RNA editing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], increases of protein hydrophobicity after editing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], correlation of editing frequency with GC content in a gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], possible association of RNA editing with gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and gain and loss of edit sites through time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The phylogenetic distribution of RNA editing across lineages of plants has also been investigated, with patterns of editing site gain and loss found to be mostly lineage specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Despites these studies, the fundamental question of how RNA editing originated in plant organellar genomes remains largely unanswered. Some researchers have suggested a hypothesis of genetic drift resulting in both the appearance of editing activity and fixation of mutations at editable sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], with a possibility of natural selection maintaining RNA editing activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, there has been no analysis using empirical data to explicitly test this hypothesis. In particular, no comprehensive analysis has been performed to examine the extent of functional difference resulted from amino acid changes caused by RNA editing, even though it is generally recognized that RNA editing involves functionally important changes in both protein-coding and structural and regulatory RNA-coding sequences. Further, in spite of the observation of hydrophobicity difference of amino acid changes involved in RNA editing in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>and <italic>Anthoceros formosae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], no attempt has been made to evaluate this change of an important physico-chemical property of amino acids from a broad perspective of the cellular compartment environment in both organelles. Chloroplasts and mitochondria house disproportionately large percentages of genes encoding membrane-bound proteins involved in electron transport and ATP synthesis in energy metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Finally, the genomic and sequence environment in which RNA editing arose remains poorly known.</p><p>Over the last ten years, a number of plants have been investigated for genome-wide RNA editing by comparing the fully sequenced organellar genomes with their mature transcriptomes. These include 11 diverse land plants for the chloroplast genome: the hornwort <italic>Anthoceros formosae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], the fern <italic>Adiantum capillus-veneris </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], the gymnosperm <italic>Pinus thunbergii </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and the angiosperms <italic>Cuscuta reflexa </italic>and <italic>C. gronovii </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], <italic>Nicotiana tabacum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], <italic>Atropa belladonna </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], <italic>Phalaenopsis aphrodite </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], <italic>Saccharum officinarum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and <italic>Zea mays </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. For the mitochondrial genome, five angiosperms have been investigated: <italic>A. thaliana </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], <italic>Brassica napus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], <italic>Beta vulgaris </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], <italic>Oryza sativa </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and partially for <italic>Zea mays </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>In the <italic>A. formosae </italic>chloroplast genome there are 509 C&#x02192;U sites distributed across 68 genes and eight ORF's, with 94, 397 and 12 sites at 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd </sup>codon positions respectively. A majority of editing events involves codon changes from NCN to NUN (Ser, Pro, Thr, Ala &#x02192; Phe, Leu, Ile, Met, Val) with editing at 2<sup>nd </sup>positions. The 433 U&#x02192;C sites in this genome are distributed across 69 genes, with 264, 149, and 16 sites occurring at 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd </sup>codon positions respectively. 81% of the edited 1<sup>st </sup>positions convert Stop (UAR) codons to those of Gln (CAR), and Cys/Stop/Trp (UGN) codons to those of Arg (CGN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In the <italic>A. capillus-veneris </italic>chloroplast genome, 51 C&#x02192;U, and all 35 U&#x02192;C editing events occur in 1<sup>st </sup>positions, while 226 and 20 C&#x02192;U changes are found at 2<sup>nd </sup>and 3<sup>rd </sup>positions respectively. Of these editing events 75% of the 1<sup>st </sup>position U&#x02192;C edits consist of Stop (UGA) to Arg (CGA) codon changes. The C&#x02192;U changes are found across 52 genes, while U&#x02192;C editing events occur in 20 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In comparison, the chloroplast genomes of seed plants contain only ~15&#x02013;44 C&#x02192;U editing sites, distributed across ~15 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. There has been an apparent loss of RNA editing sites in the chloroplast genome during evolution of land plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>While the mitochondrial genome of <italic>Marchantia polymorpha </italic>(a liverwort) lacks RNA editing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], a large number of editing sites have been found in three angiosperm mitochondrial genomes. In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, 441 C&#x02192;U sites are spread across 30 genes with the majority found at the 2<sup>nd </sup>codon positions (236), followed by 1<sup>st </sup>(154), and 3<sup>rd </sup>(51) positions. 57% of 1<sup>st </sup>position editing involves URN to CRN changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. For <italic>B. vulgaris </italic>353 C&#x02192;U sites were identified across 30 protein coding genes with 125, 198, and 30 sites found at 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd </sup>codon positions respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In <italic>O. sativa</italic>, a similar pattern has been observed, with 153, 246, and 38 editing sites at 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd </sup>positions of 29 genes respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>These data provide an opportunity to take a comparative genomic approach to investigate the question of how RNA editing evolved in plant organellar genomes. In this study, we analyzed the sequence and editing data from fully characterized organellar genomes of <italic>A. formosae, A. capillus-veneris, A. thaliana, B. vulgaris</italic>, and <italic>O. sativa</italic>, to gain a better understanding of conditions under which RNA editing evolved. Since <italic>B. napus </italic>and <italic>Z. mays </italic>are closely related to <italic>A. thaliana </italic>and <italic>O. sativa </italic>respectively, and their editing patterns are similar to each other, they were excluded from our analyses. The chloroplast genomes of <italic>P. thunbergii, A. thaliana</italic>, <italic>N. tabacum</italic>, <italic>A. belladonna</italic>, <italic>Z. mays</italic>, and other angiosperms were not analyzed here because they contained only a small number of editing sites and might not be suitable for detecting general patterns.</p><p>We first examined types of codons that were edited and their editing frequencies. In particular, we investigated the relationship between the change in hydrophobicity and molecular size of amino acids encoded by pre- and post-edited codons and the editing frequency. This analysis should allow us to assess functional significance of RNA editing. In the second set of analyses, we calculated frequencies of 20 amino acids in two groups of genes that encode membrane-bound and soluble proteins respectively, in both organelles. Comparison of occurrence frequencies of amino acids in the two organelles with the editing frequencies of codons could help identify cellular environmental factors that might have contributed to and shaped the origin and evolution of RNA editing. Finally, we performed correlation analyses between editing frequencies and i) nucleotide frequencies at the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, and total codon positions in all genes, and ii) gene specific rates of evolution at both synonymous (<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>) and nonsynonymous (<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub>) sites. These analyses might help to reveal the sequence environment in which editing evolved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Taxon sampling and annotation of editing sites</title><p>The genome sequences used in this study were obtained from the GenBank organellar genome database <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ORGANELLES/organelles.html"/>.</p><p>Annotation of RNA editing sites was performed for individual gene sequences in accordance with editing sites determined by original authors from cDNA sequences across 68 chloroplast genes of <italic>Anthoceros formosae </italic>(GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NC_004543">NC_004543</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and <italic>Adiantum capillus-veneris </italic>(GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY178864">AY178864</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].

The changes of Cys &#x02192; Arg codons and Leu &#x02192; Pro codons represent most remaining editing events at 1<sup>st </sup>and 2<sup>nd </sup>codon positions, respectively. There are a few other classes of codon changes resulted from editing that also involve changes of functionally very different amino acids, but they occur at much lower frequencies than the ones mentioned above. Finally, there are a small number of editing events that cause changes of functionally similar amino acids or do not alter amino acid identity at all (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

Even in <italic>A. formosae </italic>where almost an equal number of forward and reverse editing events were reported, this increase of protein hydrophobicity still holds because a large proportion of reverse editing events were involved in resurrecting internal stop codons and did not offset the hydrophobicity increase generated by forward editing events (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a, b</xref>).

Leu consistently ranked the highest among all 20 amino acids in membrane-bound proteins of both organelles.

These data fit basic physical chemistry expectation in that abundance of membrane-bound proteins in chloroplasts and mitochondria naturally dictates frequent use of hydrophobic amino acids in synthesizing these proteins.

Recently, Tillich et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] uncovered a pattern termed 'preferred sequence context' in which there may be a preference for pyrimidines immediately upstream, and purines immediately downstream of an editing site. Such a pattern could be important for site recognition by the RNA editing machinery. In an earlier study, Covello and Gray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] insightfully dissected the complex question into three parts: 1) the origin of RNA editing activity, 2) fixation of mutations at editable sites, and 3) maintenance of RNA editing activity. Further, they hypothesized that genetic drift played a key role in the first two processes and natural selection contributed to the third. Some authors hold an even more neutralistic view on the origin of RNA editing than these two authors, e.g., Lynch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Below we present our ideas on whether RNA editing originated under natural selection or through genetic drift based on the analyses shown above. To make the argument easier to construct according to strength of the data, we follow a reverse sequence of the three steps proposed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><sec><title>Maintenance of RNA editing activity</title><p>In agreement with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], we think that the data are overwhelming in supporting a role of natural selection in maintaining RNA editing activity in organelles of plants, despite a poor understanding of its biochemical nature until now. Without editing, replacement of so many amino acids with very different physico-chemical properties would dramatically alter protein structures, if not rendering these proteins completely disfunctional (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The most extreme case is the chloroplast genome of <italic>A. formosae</italic>, where forward and reverse editing events affect more than half of the genes in the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, stop and start codons are often created or removed by editing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Likewise, tRNAs, group II introns, and putative Shine-Dalgarno sequences that contain editing sites are also likely to be affected if editing activity is lost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Hence, we will not elaborate on this point any further here.</p></sec><sec><title>Fixation of mutations at editable sites</title><p>This is the starting point where our view differs from that of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] on how RNA editing evolved. If mutations at editable sites were fixed through genetic drift, one would expect their distribution patterns to be completely random when examined against codon positions, types of codons, and kinds of genes. However, our analyses provided ample data to contradict this scenario. First, we found editing sites to be predominantly distributed at 2<sup>nd </sup>and 1<sup>st </sup>codon positions (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), as reported by previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and found here to be correlated across genes for all taxa examined (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><p>Second, editing affected codons that resulted in larger hydrophobicity and molecular size changes much more frequently than those with little change involved, and heavy editing uniformly increased protein hydrophobicity (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In fact, there was a conspicuous lack of heavily edited codons that were translationally silent or involved in little change of hydrophobicity and molecular size. Finally, editing occurred more frequently in selectively constrained genes encoding membrane-bound proteins than those encoding soluble ones because these genes contained many U-rich codons encoding hydrophobic amino acids (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These data all support a role of natural selection in fixing mutations at editable sites and are fundamentally incompatible with a neutralistic explanation invoking genetic drift.</p><p>One point we want to clarify is that the exact point of contention in our exposition is slightly different from that of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Our argument is broader than theirs in that we argue that both fixation of editing sites and fixation of mutations at editable sites were achieved by natural selection. Theoretically, upon origin of editing activity any site with T or C could mutate to C or T (i.e., any site with T or C could fall into the category of "editable sites") since it could always revert to its original condition after editing or reverse editing. In reality, only some sites might be allowed to do so, as there might be sequence motifs involved in fixing editing sites as suggested by some authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Basically, appearance of the editing machinery relaxed selection pressure on T&#x02194;C mutations. The data on distribution of editing sites among codon positions, codons, and genes as we presented above demonstrate clearly that fixation of editing sites and fixation of mutations at editable sites followed a pattern of functional selection.</p></sec><sec><title>Origin of RNA editing activity</title><p>It has been generally recognized that origin of genes encoding enzymes involved in RNA editing represents a critical step in the origin of RNA editing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. To date, the biochemical nature of the editing machinery remains poorly characterized even though a nuclear gene encoding a protein essential for RNA editing in chloroplasts has been identified in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>].</p><p>It has also been suggested that the editing machinery probably evolved in early land plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and that the same machinery may be responsible for editing in both organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The fundamental question in the whole story of evolution of RNA editing is whether origin of the editing machinery was merely a historic accident or it represented an evolutionary innovation of necessity. Genetic drift was invoked for this event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] in the face of lack of extensive data and any obvious functional explanation. With much more data and extensive analyses, we are inclined to take a different view here.</p><p>While we agree that the origin of RNA editing activity itself is clearly a neutral event, we suggest that it may confer some fitness to the organellar genomes. Otherwise, it is inconceivable that such a mutation would have been fixed and then maintained in land plant organelle genomes over a course of evolution of more than four hundred million years. We offer a hypothesis below.</p><p>One basic fact we want to point out is that editing allows a higher GC content in the genome, because forward editing permits fixation of C in the sense strand and G in the antisense strand, and genes in organellar genomes are distributed on both strands of a circular molecule. Perhaps there is an upper limit of AT% that is permitted in a genome and this upper limit may have promoted fixation of the genes encoding enzymes involved in RNA editing.</p><p>To strengthen this argument, we remind readers that the genetic code table and start and stop codons in this table mandate presence of all four nucleotides in a genome. Thus, AT content in any genome certainly cannot exceed 100%, and no genome consisted of less than all four nucleotides has ever been reported. Still, we acknowledge that a link between the base composition of a genome and RNA editing frequency is weak even though the two phenomena are compatible. Further, reverse editing, which occurs frequently in the chloroplast genome of <italic>A. formosae</italic>, and is correlated strongly with the frequency of forward editing (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), poses a problem to our explanation. However, if organellar genomes were under pressure, not only to reduce AT, but also to equilibrate the overall nucleotide composition under the second parity rule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], then a reduction of T would also reduce A, and an increase in C would likewise increase G. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> shows the dramatic convergence of nucleotide composition toward the equilibrium value (25%) during the early evolution of land plants. This pattern is observed both at whole genome level and across conserved protein-coding genes in both mitochondria and chloroplasts, and may signify a 'drive' for convergence of the four nucleotides toward the equilibrium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).

Colonization of land by charophytic algal ancestors of land plants, life history characteristics of individual species, the evolutionary history of particular lineages, lineage-specific GC contents in organellar genomes, different substitution rates in chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of some plants, different degrees of asymmetrical distribution of genes on two strands in the circular organellar genomes, DNA polymerase infidelity and dNTP pool imbalances, and varying intragenomic rearrangement rates in different plant lineages may have all or partly contributed to the origin of editing activity. Especially, the first three processes could result in species undergoing bottleneck periods during which genetic drift could play a large role in fixing random mutations. However, explicit data are needed to tie any of these factors to evolution of RNA editing before a hypothesis favoring any one of them can be seriously entertained.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our analyses of RNA editing patterns in chloroplast genomes of the hornwort <italic>A. formosae </italic>and the fern <italic>A. capillus-veneris </italic>and mitochondrial genomes of three angiosperms, <italic>A. thaliana, B. vulgaris </italic>and <italic>O. sativa </italic>show that editing mostly affects functionally important and evolutionarily conserved codon positions, codons and genes encoding membrane-bound proteins. In particular, occurrence of abundant RNA editing events in plant organellar genomes may be attributed to the disproportionately large percentages of genes in these two genomes that encode membrane-bound proteins, which are rich in hydrophobic amino acids encoded by the 2<sup>nd </sup>position U (T)-rich codons. These data support a hypothesis that natural selection imposed by protein functional constraints has contributed to selective fixation of certain editing sites and maintenance of the editing activity in plant organelles over a period of more than four hundred millions years. The retention of genes encoding RNA editing activity may be driven by forces that shape nucleotide composition equilibrium in two organellar genomes of these plants. However, the causes of lineage-specific occurrence of a large portion of RNA editing sites remain to be determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>A: adenosine; C: cytidine; cDNA: complementary DNA; cp: chloroplast; G: guanosine; mt: mitochondrion; T: thymidine; U: uridine</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RWJ and YLQ designed and performed research, analyzed data, and wrote the paper.</p></sec><sec><title>Reviewer comments</title><sec><title>Reviewers report 1: Michael Gray, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University</title><p>In the original three-step model of Covello and Gray (On the evolution of RNA editing. <italic>Trends Genet</italic>. 1993 Aug;9(8):265-8), it is admittedly rather difficult to cleanly differentiate among the three steps because the model is so obviously a co-evolutionary one (editing sites + editing machinery). A salient point that Jobson and Qiu make here is that "the genomic and sequence environment in which RNA editing arose remains poorly known". That's an important point because it somewhat constrains what we can infer about the beginnings of plant RNA editing by looking at the end result (i.e., contemporary organellar genomes).</p><sec><title>Authors' response</title><p><italic>The original three-step model of origin and evolution of RNA editing proposed by Covello-Gray (1993) is still a logical one in our opinion. That is why we used it to construct the last part of our discussion in the paper in light of the new data. We disagree with the co-evolution argument. The RNA editing activity (or machinery) has to evolve first; otherwise editing sites will not appear because mutations at those sites will almost certainly be wiped out and not be fixed given the drastic phenotypic effect they cause as demonstrated in this paper</italic>.</p><p>It also matters precisely what one means by 'originate', and where the transition from 'origin' to 'maintenance' occurs. Jobson and Qiu agree, as set out in the Covello-Gray model, that "the origin of RNA editing activity itself is clearly a neutral event", although they suggest that "it may confer some fitness to the organellar genomes". I wouldn't dispute the latter statement, especially if RNA editing originated in a relatively AT-rich genome whose descendents were increasingly subjected to a GC drive that tended to make the genome more GC-rich. The hydrophobicity argument the authors make is an excellent one, so that RNA editing would not only have the consequence of 'correcting' obvious 'mistakes' (such as the edits that serve to generate two essential ligands in the Cu<sub>A </sub>binding site of wheat Cox2, or creation of translation start and/or stop signals) but a more subtle function of ensuring that the amino acid composition of predominantly membrane-associated proteins is optimized. Even so, it's not clear to me that Jobson and Qiu aren't already talking about selective forces operating at the level of maintenance, rather than at the level of origin per se. As to whether the origin of the editing machinery "was merely a historic accident or it represented an evolutionary innovation of necessity", a primary tenet in evolutionary theory is that evolution cannot be and is not anticipatory, so that I would find 'innovation of necessity' a difficult concept to swallow. However, once having arisen in a neutral context, such an activity would most certainly be subject to strong selection, for all the reasons the authors enunciate. Thus, Jobson and Qiu list a number of factors that they suggest could have contributed to the <italic>origin </italic>of editing activity. In contrast, I would argue that these factors would have contributed to the <italic>maintenance </italic>of editing activity (i.e., selection). This view would address the authors' concern about how "such machinery would have been maintained in land plant organelles over a course of evolution of more than four hundred million years."</p><p>[On the issue of RNA editing machinery, we have to consider not only the catalytic activity (deaminase(?), at least for C&#x02192;U) but also the many trans-acting protein factors (PPR proteins?) that evidently provide the specificity for plant organellar editing. The evolution via multiple gene duplications and diversifications of the interesting multi-gene family that encodes PPR proteins may provide clues as to such features as the lineage-specific editing on which Jobson and Qiu comment.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' response</title><p><italic>Although we used the three-step model, we do not have to be confined by semantic or even conceptual details of that model in the discussion here. The central argument here is what step in the whole process of origin and evolution of RNA editing arose in a neutral way. In our view, the only neutral aspect involves the mutations that contributed to the origin of RNA editing activity, i.e., the nature of mutational change is neutral. Fixation of these mutations and thus the RNA editing activity, as well as editable sites and mutations at those sites (only C &#x0003c;-&#x0003e; T changes, not any others) were all under selection</italic>.</p><p><italic>The other important point we want to add here is that while the nature of mutational changes leading to the origin of RNA editing activity is neutral, the genomic environment in which these mutations arose is a history-constrained one (most of that history has been under selection). To put it explicitly, these mutations must represent a subset of all possible mutations that could possibly occur and the subset is shaped by the history of the genome, which is a selective one</italic>.</p><p><italic>Finally, we actually disagree with the statement "a primary tenet in evolutionary theory is that evolution cannot be and is not anticipatory". In our view, evolution of life on earth is proceeding in a way that is shaped by the constant inflow of solar energy into the life system, and with <underline>sufficient</underline> knowledge, evolution of life on this planet <underline>is</underline> anticipatory</italic>.</p><p>Another issue that is not generally considered is the effect that editing may have on the efficiency of translation of an edited mRNA, not just its translatability <italic>per se </italic>or the properties of the final protein product. In the case of plant mitochondria, the tRNA population is a mix of 'native' mtDNA-encoded tRNAs inherited vertically from a bacterial ancestor, 'chloroplast-like' tRNAs expressed from pieces of chloroplast genome that have become incorporated into the mitochondrial genome, and imported (nucleus-encoded cytosolic) tRNAs. Because the mix of these three types differs in diverse plants, it seems to me that editing might play some role in re-tailoring a message so that it is more efficiently translated by the particular mitochondrial tRNA population in a given plant species, an idea explicitly outlined in the case of dinoflagellate mRNA editing [Lin S, Zhang H, Spencer DF, Norman JE, Gray MW. Widespread and extensive editing of mitochondrial mRNAS in dinoflagellates. <italic>J Mol Biol</italic>. 2002. Jul 19;320(4):727-39].</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' response</title><p><italic>This is an interesting fact to consider. However, only seed plants have a mix of 'native' mtDNA-encoded tRNAs inherited vertically from a bacterial ancestor, 'chloroplast-like' tRNAs expressed from pieces of chloroplast genome that have become incorporated into the mitochondrial genome, and imported (nucleus-encoded cytosolic) tRNAs. The mitochondrial genomes of bryophytes lack any tRNA genes from the chloroplast genome, yet RNA editing almost certainly already occurs in the moss Physcomitrella patens and the hornwort Megaceros aenigmaticus mitochondria (Li, L., B. Wang, Y. Liu, &#x00026; Y.-L. Qiu. 2008. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the hornwort Megaceros aenigmaticus reveals a mixed mode of conservative yet dynamic evolution in early land plant mitochondrial genomes. J. Mol. Evol. submitted). Whether the mixed population of tRNAs has anything to do with RNA editing remains to be investigated, but sufficient data are not available at present</italic>.</p><p>Just as Covello and I considered that the RNA editing machinery (whatever it is) would have emerged under neutral conditions, we imagined that editable sites would have emerged in the same way, perhaps as a result of the GC-drive I mentioned earlier. In our model, we defined "editable positions or sites at the level of DNA not only as sites that are capable of being edited (the conventional meaning of editable), but also those that already correspond to the edited sequence. In the case of plant organelles in which C&#x02192;U editing occurs, editable sites can be recognized at the RNA level by the editing machinery and contain either a T or a C in the DNA at the position that is actually edited. The mutations in Step 2 would be between Ts and Cs at these editable positions in the DNA." Thus, not every C position in a sequence is an editable site, only those that can be recognized by the RNA machinery. Importantly, we also argued that "Step 1, the appearance of RNA editing activity, has the very important effect of making these transitions neutral." We actually did say that it "is possible to argue for a selective advantage of RNA editing, perhaps as a result of the different nucleotide composition of DNA and RNA (i.e. higher GC content in kinetoplastid and plant organellar DNA)", although admittedly we went on to say that "we do not think this suggestion can easily be supported." Given the data now available and considering some of the arguments Jobson and Qiu make, I would be more inclined now to accept that possibility, although again I would point out that the distinction between 'origin' and 'maintenance' becomes quickly blurred in these models.</p><p>In regard to the authors' statement, "If mutations at editable sites were fixed through genetic drift, one would expect their distribution patterns to be completely random when examined against codon positions, types of codons, and kinds of genes", I would argue that's not necessarily the case if, in fact, one accepts that (i) editable sites, by definition, are non-random because they have to be capable of being recognized by the editing machinery (otherwise non-editable T&#x02192;C mutations would quickly be eliminated by purifying selection), and (ii) the three codon positions are not equally C-rich (in angiosperms, at least, the 3rd codon position is ~40% T).</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' response</title><p><italic>Regarding point (i): Once the structural and functional aspects of the editing machinery are solved we will be in a better position to answer this question. Does the machinery have to recognize a single site? If it utilizes a sequence motif, then the conversion will depend on the nucleotide composition of the motif</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Reviewers report 2: Kirsten Krause, Department of Biology, University of Troms&#x000f8;. Solicited by Martin Lercher (lercher@cs.uni-duesseldorf.de)</title><p>Jobson and Qiu present an analysis of RNA editing sites in two chloroplast genomes and, three mitochondrial genomes of land plants. With this, they aimed at improving our understanding of how the two editing reactions (C to U and U to C conversion) that exist in the plant organellar genomes could have evolved.</p><p>I have two major (I. and II.) and two minor problems (III. and IV.) with the way this work is presented and interpreted:</p><p>I. The authors present data that were by and large known before, but they offer a different interpretation of these data. The focus of their manuscript is, therefore, more towards presenting and justifying a new hypothesis that may help to unravel the mystery of how RNA editing in plant organellar genomes evolved, than towards a gain of actual and reproducible knowledge. Unfortunately, the authors were quite biased in the presentation of their arguments. They amply refer to the important paper of Covello and Gray of 1993 on the evolution of RNA editing while the thorough and much more recently published broad scale analysis by Tillich et al. (2006) is almost unmentioned. If this manuscript is to present a valuable reference for future research, the authors should take a broader approach in their discussion and name all the pros and cons of the different views on a still undecided question. In my opinion, the study by Tillich et al. (2006) has taken such a broad approach already with an investigation of the plastid genomes of several taxa that were similar or even identical to those used in the present study, including also a discussion on plant mitochondrial genomes. The authors should mention this more explicitly here and point out where their own analysis deviates from this previous work.</p><sec><title>Authors' response</title><p><italic>We agree that the Tillich et al</italic>., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]<italic> study is comprehensive and thought provoking, and we have discussed and cited the work in the current paper. However, in our view the 'preferred sequence context' pattern is most likely an artifact of: 1) the observed higher frequency of TTA (UUA) codons in organellar genomes of plants (~X3 that of TTG in Anthoceros cp CDS), in combination with 2) the fact that Leu is very common in transmembrane regions, and 3) UCA&#x02192;UUA is one of the most common edits. Therefore, you would expect a high probability of an A or T up or down stream of an edit site. Whether or not the thus-far unknown editing machinery structure requires such a recognition pattern obviously cannot yet be determined</italic>.</p><p>II. The authors state quite correctly in the introduction that seed plants have experienced a loss of editing sites in their plastids compared to the more primitive ferns and hornworts. This is an important fact that should be included in the discussion about the evolution of RNA editing because it shows that it is an ongoing mechanism and not a thing of the past. Unfortunately, the authors excluded the plastid genomes of seed plants from their analysis and also largely from their discussion. It might be worthwhile to reconsider this decision and elaborate more on how the fact that RNA editing of many but not all sites seems to have been lost, fits in with their interpretation. What made some sites apparently prone to mutation at the DNA level whereas other sites still depend on a change at the RNA level?</p><p>Alternatively, the authors should drop their claim of presenting a broad scale analysis and should clearly restrict their arguments to those organelles and taxa they analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' response</title><p><italic>The RNA edited codon frequency pattern we observed (e.g., often UUR) in chloroplasts of Anthoceros and Adiantum, and mitochondria of angiosperms (involving hundreds of sites across 29&#x02013;58 genes), is similar to that found across the ~15&#x02013;44 editing sites (most in just a few genes) in seed plant chloroplast genomes. The several studies we have cited contain tables of the edited codons. We have included in the text a statement explaining that these codon data fit our model (e.g., mostly UUR), and we refer the reader to the codon tables in the relevant literature</italic>.</p><p>III. Furthermore, it has been suggested by other authors that there seems to be an inverse correlation between mutation rates and RNA editing frequency and that,....</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' response</title><p><italic>An intriguing observation. To test this hypothesis we performed correlation analyses of editing frequency versus gene specific rates of evolution across nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) sites </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), <italic>and found an inverse relationship for dN, but not dS. So it seems that the suggested inverse relationship is associated more with selection constraint on the gene than with the overall mutation rate. Such an analysis can be confounded by the editing sites themselves. For this reason we removed the editing effect from the sequences, and sampled across a broad range of taxa</italic>.</p><p>...therefore, RNA editing originated as a mechanism to complement the low mutation rates in the organellar genomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' response</title><p><italic>This is an interesting idea; however, we wonder why it would be the case? The genome does not 'know' that it has a low or high mutation rate. Unless there is, for example, some environmental change that places selection pressure on the genome to undergo changes in function, would you expect the genomic diversity to really matter if the required enzymes are still properly produced for Mt function? For the evolution and maintenance of RNA editing sites, it seems that changes in mutation rate only matter if mutation rate and negative selection are not in sync. This process would best be determined through population genetic studies that consider life history and/or ecological factors</italic>.</p><p>In this context, recent data describing an even further reduction in RNA editing activity in the reduced plastid genomes of some parasitic plant species which exhibit a high rate of mutations in their plastid genome (Funk et al. 2007, BMC Plant Biology 7:45) would be well worth discussing.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' response</title><p><italic>We thank the reviewer and have now cited the work of Funk et al. 2008. One would expect reduced RNA-editing activity in a genome that is in a state of functional degradation</italic>.</p><p>IV. The argument that reaching a desired GC-content (or avoiding a presumed upper limit of % A+T) could have promoted the fixation of the genes encoding enzymes involved in RNA editing is very questionable as even in the most extensive cases editing activity concerns just a relatively tiny fraction of sites compared to the total amount of nucleotides in coding sequences and therefore cannot have altered the G+C content by more than a fraction of one percent.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' response</title><p><italic>As clearly outlined in the preceding sentence of the text, we do not suggest that the editing sites themselves have altered the nucleotide frequency, or that editing evolved to attain "desired" nucleotide frequencies. Instead, we suggest that whole genome processes of nucleotide compositional re-organization during early land plant diversification (see </italic>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref><italic>) could be selectively unfavorable within and across most of the protein coding genes particularly regarding a loss of hydrophobicity in membrane-bound proteins. The editing machinery probably evolved to maintain protein structural fidelity in the face of the compositional re-organization mentioned above. The underlying process of nucleotide compositional re-organization could then occur in these genes, and the rest of the genome, dependent on levels of selective constraint (see Selaginella uncinata </italic>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). <italic>As the nucleotide composition stabilized in seed plants </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), <italic>the corresponding editing frequencies have lowered. We do not yet have the Mt genome-transcriptome for an early land plant (e.g., hornwort, fern). However, from single locus studies of Mt genes it seems likely that editing site frequencies in these early lineages will greatly exceed those found in Mt genomes of seed plants</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Reviewers report 3: Jeffery Mower, Center for Plant Science Innovation, University of Nebraska Lincoln. Solicited by David Ardell (dardell@ucmerced.edu)</title><p>This manuscript attempts to address questions regarding the origin and evolution of RNA editing. Specifically, the authors wish to explore whether selection played a more prominent role than has been previously appreciated. I have several questions and concerns regarding their conclusions which are outlined below.</p><p>1. The authors make the very strong assertion that the functional basis of RNA editing is to increase hydrophobicity. I'd like to point out some facts that are not consistent with this assertion:</p><p>a) For reverse edits, the most heavily edited codons (that do not fix stop codons) are those that cause large decreases in hydrophobicity (C&#x0003e;R and L&#x0003e;P). If their assertion is correct, you'd expect that reverse edits causing large decreases in hydrophobicity would be the least frequent, not the most frequent. Thus, although the function of forward editing may be to increase hydrophobicity, this cannot be the case for reverse editing because it does the exact opposite.</p><p>b) The authors claim on p. 14 that the abundance of S&#x0003e;L and P&#x0003e;L changes clearly supports the role of editing to increase hydrophobicity. However, why is it then that T&#x0003e;I changes are one of the least frequent types of edits? On the Kyte-Doolittle scale, T&#x0003e;I changes would cause a greater increase in hydrophobicity than would S&#x0003e;L changes. Increasing hydrophobicity cannot be the only driving factor.</p><sec><title>Authors' response</title><p><italic>We do not suggest that the <underline>role </underline>of editing is 'to increase hydrophobicity', although without editing a change in hydrophobicity would be the 'effect'. Obviously maintenance of hydrophobicity is under strong selection in genomes containing mostly membrane-bound protein coding genes. Instead, we have investigated the cause, or rather, the genomic environment in which RNA editing may have arisen. In early land plants a pattern of nucleotide re-arrangement was taking place </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) <italic>and editing probably evolved to compensate for such changes in nucleotide frequency &#x02013; possibly driven by increased C&#x0003c;-&#x0003e;T transitions</italic>.</p><p><italic>If editing activity suddenly ceased, there would be an overall decrease in hydrophobicity (ignoring the effects of edited stop codons). That is not to say that a proportion of edit sites would not 'increase' hydrophobicity &#x02013; and these may well be equally deleterious or disruptive. Our precise point is that editing restores amino acids with the 'correct' physico-chemical properties. In the genomes we examined, this pattern is most obvious regarding increased hydrophobicity <underline>after</underline> editing</italic>.</p><p>c) Compositional analyses have shown that there is a strong preference for pyrimidine immediately upstream of edited sites and a mild preference for purine immediately downstream. This preferred sequence context of edit sites goes a long way in explaining the patterns observed in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, and it provides a clear explanation for the abundance of S&#x0003e;L and P&#x0003e;L changes and dearth of T&#x0003e;I and A&#x0003e;V changes. I suspect that editing frequency would correlate better with sequence context than with hydrophobicity change.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' response</title><p><italic>The 'preferred sequence context' should correlate well with editing frequency, as does the frequency of NUN codons </italic>(see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), <italic>because they are basically the same phenomenon.

I believe the authors have failed to capture all of the complexities in their discussion of editing's origin and evolution. a) When thinking about the evolution of editing there are three states that must be considered. For a forward edit site you could have 1) a genomically encoded T, 2) an edited C, or 3) an unedited C. Clearly, at these positions an edited C is preferable to an unedited C, which is the simple reason for the maintenance of this edited site by selection. But when discussing the fixation of a new edit site, you must compare the edited C state to the ancestral state of a genomic T. What is the selective benefit to going from a genomic T to an edited C? Clearly it cannot be some protein-level effect (such as hydrophobicity), because both states generate a U in the RNA leading to identical AAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' response</title><p><italic>We have addressed this misunderstanding above. The protein level 'effect' is what would happen if editing suddenly ceased. The question of how sites are fixed as edit sites in the first instance is a question that requires population level studies. It is probable that during the divergence of land plants, lineages underwent periods of reduced selection pressure. The 'editing machinery' was probably a means of fixation of selectively constrained pyrimidines under these reduced selection periods. Once the machinery was established the edited sites could persist and be edited, persist and be unedited, or change back to the original pyrimidine (purified)</italic>.</p><p>b) Elsewhere the authors argue that the non-random distribution of editing is evidence that selection was responsible for their fixation and is incompatible with a neutral fixation scenario. I disagree with this statement. Instead, I would contend that the present-day distribution results from neutral fixation coupled with differences in the selection pressure to maintain edit sites (eg, there are so few 3rd position edit sites because they are silent at the protein level so there is no selection to maintain them).</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' response</title><p><italic>Good points. However, the reviewer has left out an important point in the argument: Selection on the editing machinery to establish fixation in the first instance</italic>.</p><p>3. I don't see the big conclusions to be drawn from Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and its associated text. The first observation is that "RNA editing sites occur more frequently in ancestrally T-rich sequences." This really isn't all that surprising as the authors also point out. I certainly don't find it necessary to see the massive figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> to believe this; a simple statement would suffice. The other observation is that "genes encoding membrane-bound proteins tend to have larger T &#x02013; A distances." Isn't this simply because codons with T code for more hydrophobic AAs than codons with A, and membrane-bound proteins require more of these T-rich codons? For example, codons with T at the 2nd pos (FLIMV) are very hydrophobic, whereas codons with A at the 2nd pos (YHQNKDE) are not. Again, I don't see the necessity of the figure or the text in the manuscript.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' response</title><p><italic>Regarding our observation; 'RNA editing sites occur more frequently in ancestrally T-rich sequences', the reviewer states "This really isn't all that surprising".
