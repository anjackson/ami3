    "Sanionia uncinata is a dominant moss species in the maritime Antarctic. Due to its high adaptability to harsh environments, this extremophile plant has been considered a good target for studying the molecular adaptation mechanisms of plants to a variety of environmental stresses. Despite the importance of S. uncinata as a representative Antarctic plant species for the identification and characterization of genes associated with abiotic stress tolerance, suitable reference genes, which are critical for RT-qPCR analyses, have not yet been identified. In this report, 11 traditionally used and 6 novel candidate reference genes were selected from transcriptome data of S. uncinata and the expression stability of these genes was evaluated under various abiotic stress conditions using three statistical algorithms; geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. The stability ranking analysis selected the best reference genes depending on the stress conditions. Among the 17 candidates, the most stable references were POB1 and UFD2 for cold stress, POB1 and AKB for drought treatment, and UFD2 and AKB for the field samples from a different water contents in Antarctica. Overall, novel genes POB1 and AKB were the most reliable references across all samples, irrespective of experimental conditions. In addition, 6 novel candidate genes including AKB, POB1 and UFD2, were more stable than the housekeeping genes traditionally used for internal controls, indicating that transcriptome data can be useful for identifying novel robust normalizers. The reference genes validated in this study will be useful for improving the accuracy of RT-qPCR analysis for gene expression studies of S. uncinata in Antarctica and for further functional genomic analysis of bryophytes."
