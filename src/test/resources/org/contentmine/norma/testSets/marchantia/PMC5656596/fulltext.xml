Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a natural auxin, is mainly biosynthesized by two sequential enzyme reactions catalyzed by TAA1 and YUCCA (YUC). TAA1 is involved in the conversion of tryptophan to IPA, and YUC catalyzes the conversion of IPA to IAA. We previously demonstrated that yucasin inhibits AtYUC1 enzyme activity and suppress high-auxin phenotype of YUC overexpression plants, although yucasin displayed weak effects on the auxin-related phenotype of wild-type plants. To develop more potent YUC inhibitors, various derivatives of yucasin were synthesized, and their structure&#x02013;activity relationships were investigated. Yucasin difluorinated analog (YDF) (5-[2,6-difluorophenyl]-2,4-dihydro-[1,2,4]-triazole-3-thione) was identified to be a more potent YUC inhibitor than the original yucasin. YDF caused an auxin-deficient phenotype in Arabidopsis wild-type plants that was restored with auxin application. YDF was found to be highly stable regarding metabolic conversion <italic>in vivo</italic>, accounting for the potent activity of the inhibition of IAA biosynthesis in planta. Photoaffinity labeling experiments demonstrated that yucasin-type inhibitors bind to the active site of AtYUC1. YDF is a promising auxin biosynthesis inhibitor and is a useful chemical tool for plant biology and agrochemical studies.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The plant hormone auxin is a master regulator for plant growth and development.

TAA1 and YUC orthologs are widely found in diverse land plants, such as the liverworts, mosses, ferns and vascular plants, and the IPA pathway is believed to be main IAA biosynthetic route in land plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.

The function of target proteins can be spatiotemporally modulated by small molecules in any tissue or cell. Furthermore, small molecules can overcome the redundant activity of cognate genes and therefore can be an effective tool for studying diverse plant species inaccessible via genetic approaches. Recently, several auxin biosynthesis inhibitors targeting the IPA pathway have been discovered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. L-&#x003b1;-aminooxyphenylpropionic acid (AOPP) and its potent derivative pyruvamine (PVM) were reported to be TAA inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. TAA is pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme whose aminooxy moiety can bind PLP to inhibit oxime formation of PLP with substrate. PVM inhibits IAA biosynthesis and results in a severe auxin-deficient phenotype in several plants. L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn) has been reported to be a competitive inhibitor of TAA1 by chemical library screening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. L-Kyn is a metabolite of L-tryptophan via tryptophan dioxygenase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Kakei <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that the phenyl boronic acid derivatives 4-biphenylboronic acid (BBo) and 4-phenoxyphenylboronic acid (PPBo) displayed very potent inhibition of the YUC enzyme and then repressed IAA biosynthesis, conferring an auxin-deficient phenotype to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In a previous study, we demonstrated that yucasin (5-[4-chlorophenyl]-2,4-dihydro-[1,2,4]-triazole-3-thione) was identified as a YUC inhibitor from synthetic chemical library.

Among the various analogs, we identified a yucasin difluorinated analog (YDF: <bold>1</bold>) (5-[2,6-difluorophenyl]-2,4-dihydro-[1,2,4]-triazole-3-thione) as a potent, reversible YUC inhibitor using YUC-overexpressing transgenic plants harboring an auxin-responsive <italic>DR5::GUS</italic> reporter system. YDF caused an auxin-deficient phenotype in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants and in lower land plants such as mosses and liverworts. The auxin-deficient phenotype caused by YDF was restored with auxin application. Based on the SAR results, we designed photoaffinity analogs of yucasin. Photoaffinity labeling experiments of AtYUC6 confirmed that yucasin-type inhibitors bind to the active site of YUC6 in competition with the substrate. Finally, we simultaneously blocked the IPA and CYP79B auxin biosynthesis pathways using a combination of the inhibitors and mutants for auxin biosynthesis and signaling, and the results suggested auxin null phenotype of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Evaluation of inhibitory activity for yucasin analogs using AtYUC6 overexpression plants</title><p id="Par6">Yucasin was identified as an inhibitor of the YUC enzyme in the IPA pathway.

Yucasin-type inhibitors could be hydrolyzed <italic>in planta</italic> and are converted to thiosemicarbazide and corresponding carboxylic acid. Indeed, some aromatic carboxylic acids from analogs showed the inhibition of plant growth, suggesting that the stability of analogs may partly contribute to off-target effects on root growth. Methimazole (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) has a similar structure of 1,2,4-triazole-3(4&#x02009;<italic>H</italic>)-thione moiety in yucasin, and methimazole is reported to be an inhibitor of flavin-containing monooxygenases involving the YUC family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. We modified the 1,2,4-triazole-3(4&#x02009;<italic>H</italic>)-thione moiety of yucasin analogs (<bold>36</bold>, <bold>37</bold> and <bold>38</bold>); however, all modifications resulted in the complete loss of inhibitory activity, indicating that the 1,2,4-triazole-3(4&#x02009;<italic>H</italic>)-thione moiety is essential for binding to YUC. The structure&#x02013;activity relationship (SAR) study of the phenyl moiety in yucasin analogs did not provide any rational regularity regarding the binding affinity of the analogs to the YUC enzyme. In our assay using the <italic>DR5::GUS</italic> reporter in <italic>pMDC7::YUC6</italic>, the analogs were evaluated as effective inhibitors <italic>in planta</italic>. Several factors such as the membrane permeability, metabolic stability and binding affinity of the analogs affected the inhibitory activity in the <italic>in planta</italic> assays. Our SAR results implied that the substitution of the phenyl ring of the analogs affects both the metabolic stability <italic>in planta</italic> and the binding affinity to YUC.</p><p id="Par21">The naturally occurring auxin IAA is thought to be mainly biosynthesized by the IPA pathway. In addition, IAA is supplied from the intermediates IBA, IAM, TAM and IAN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Phenylacetic acid (PAA) is recognized as an endogenous auxin, but the physiological function and biosynthetic pathway of PAA has not been unveiled<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In the Brassicaceae, IAA is also supplied from an alternative minor IAOx pathway involving CYP79B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants, 3 <italic>TAA</italic> genes and 11 <italic>YUC</italic> genes function in the IPA pathway, and 2 <italic>CYP79B</italic> genes are involved in the IAOx pathway. Other enzymes responsible for the minor pathway of IAA supplies have not been revealed. These complicated metabolic pathways and redundant gene families for IAA biosynthesis would prevent the access of genetic approaches to studying the IAA biosynthetic pathway of various plant species. We blocked the genetically assigned IAA synthetic pathways (the IPA and IAOx pathways) by the combination of TAA and YUC inhibitors and the <italic>cyp79b2 79b3</italic> double mutant. The inhibition of both IPA and IAOx pathways resulted in a more impaired phenotype than that from the inhibition of the IPA pathway alone, but the plants still slightly grew in the absence of both pathways. The auxin antagonist auxinole blocked the auxin response derived from the minor IAA supply and PAA. Co-treatment with YDF, L-Kyn and auxinole completely blocked plant growth after the cotyledons opened. This evidence implies that the minor IAA supply and another natural auxin such as PAA play a role in auxin-regulated plant development.</p><p id="Par22">YDF was identified as a potent inhibitor <italic>in planta</italic>, but the <italic>in vitro</italic> enzymatic inhibitory activity of YDF was much lower than that of yucasin. We revealed that YDF is a metabolically stable analog of yucasin and therefore showed potent activity <italic>in planta</italic>. Photoaffinity labeling experiments confirmed that the yucasin-type inhibitor binds to the active site of the YUC enzyme. The substrate recognition residue of the binding site may be conserved among land plants, implying yucasin-type inhibitors may be effective on diverse kinds of land plants. YDF was demonstrated to be effective on mosses and liverworts in addition to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). These results demonstrated that YDF is a promising chemical tool for auxin biology in diverse land plants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Synthesis of the yucasin analogs and photoaffinity yucasin probe</title><p id="Par23">Yucasin analogs were synthesized in accordance with method A or method B as described below.
