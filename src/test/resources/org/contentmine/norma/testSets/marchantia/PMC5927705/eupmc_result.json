    "Chloroplasts alter their subcellular positions in response to ambient light and temperature conditions. This well-characterized light-induced response, which was first described nearly 100Â years ago, is regulated by the blue-light photoreceptor, phototropin. By contrast, the molecular mechanism of low temperature-induced chloroplast relocation (i.e., the cold-avoidance response) was unexplored until its discovery in the fern Adiantum capillus-veneris in 2008. Because this response is also regulated by phototropin, it was thought to occur in a blue light-dependent manner. However, until recently, the blue light dependency of this response could not be examined due to the lack of a stable light source under cold conditions. We recently refined the light source to precisely control light intensity under cold conditions. Using this light source, we observed the blue light dependency of the cold-avoidance response in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha and the phototropin2-mediated cold-avoidance response in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Thus, this mechanism is evolutionarily conserved among land plants."
