Ll.LtrB interrupts the relaxase gene of three <italic>L. lactis</italic> conjugative elements. The relaxase enzyme recognizes the origin of transfer (<italic>oriT&#x02009;</italic>) and initiates the intercellular transfer of its conjugative element. The splicing efficiency of Ll.LtrB from the relaxase transcript thus controls the conjugation level of its host element. Here, we used the level of sex factor conjugation as a read-out for Ll.LtrB splicing efficiency. Using this highly sensitive splicing/conjugation assay (10<sup>7</sup>-fold detection range), we demonstrate that Ll.LtrB can trans-splice in <italic>L. lactis</italic> when fragmented at various positions such as: three different locations within domain IV, within domain I and within domain III. We also demonstrate that the intron-encoded protein, LtrA, is absolutely required for Ll.LtrB trans-splicing. Characteristic Y-branched trans-spliced introns and ligated exons are detected by RT-PCR from total RNA extracts of cells harbouring fragmented Ll.LtrB. The splicing/conjugation assay we developed constitutes the first model system to study group II intron trans-splicing <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although only previously observed in bacterial-derived organelles, we demonstrate that assembly and trans-splicing of a fragmented group II intron can take place efficiently in bacterial cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Group II introns are large ribozymes that catalyse their own excision from RNA transcripts through a process called splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). Some group II introns that harbour an open reading frame (ORF) are also mobile retroelements, which are capable of invading new DNA sites using an RNA intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Group II introns are found in bacteria, archaea and bacterial-derived organelles of lower eukaryotes and higher plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>Splicing of group II introns is achieved by two consecutive transesterification reactions (A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The 2&#x02032;-OH of a bulged adenosine (A) found near the 3&#x02032; end of the intron initiates the first nucleophilic attack on the exon 1&#x02013;intron junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, step 1). This results in a 2&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; branching of the intron on the bulged adenosine and the release of exon 1. The liberated 3&#x02032;-OH of exon 1 initiates the second nucleophilic attack on the intron&#x02013;exon 2 junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, step 2), thereby releasing the intron in the form of a lariat and ligating the two exons. This splicing mechanism is identical to the removal of nuclear eukaryotic introns by the spliceosome, therefore suggesting a common origin for these two classes of introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).

The 2&#x02032;OH of the bulged adenosine present in domain VI of the intron (circled A) performs the initial nucleophilic attack on the exon 1&#x02013;intron junction (step 1), generating a 2&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; linkage, also known as a branch point. Then, the 3&#x02032;-OH of the released exon 1 performs the second nucleophilic attack on the intron&#x02013;exon 2 junction (step 2), releasing the intron lariat and ligating the flanking exons.

However, their secondary structure is universally conserved and is composed of six domains radiating from a central hub (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). Domain I is transcribed first, and when folded, it provides the scaffold to dock the other folded intron domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Domain IV plays little if any role in catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and was shown to be dispensable for splicing <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In many cases, the loop region of domain IV contains an ORF expressing an intron-encoded protein (IEP), which provides essential functions for both intron splicing and mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Domain V is the catalytic domain of these ribozymes and its sequence is the most conserved among group II introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Domain VI carries the branch point nucleotide, which is most often an adenosine. The structure of this domain is believed to place the branch point nucleotide near the 5&#x02032; splice site in a position that allows initiation of the first nucleophilic attack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, step 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>In addition to local base pairing, a series of long-range interactions between the various folded domains were characterized (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, greek symbols) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). For instance, recognition of the exon&#x02013;intron boundaries is achieved via long-range interactions between domain I and both exons. In general, domain I harbours the exon-binding sites 1 and 2 (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, EBS1 and EBS2), which are involved in 5&#x02032; splice site recognition through base pairing interactions with exon 1. The sequences of these exon-binding sites are complementary to contiguous intron-binding sites 1 and 2 located at the 3&#x02032; end of exon 1 (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, IBS1 and IBS2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Similarly, the intron&#x02013;exon 2 splice junction is recognized by either the &#x003b4;&#x02013;&#x003b4;&#x02032; or EBS3&#x02013;IBS3 interaction between domain I and exon 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Another important long-range interaction, &#x003b6;&#x02013;&#x003b6;&#x02032;, links the GNRA tetraloop of domain V to a phylogenetically conserved stem-loop structure within domain I (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). This tertiary interaction is thought to form the intron catalytic core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). It was previously demonstrated that tertiary interactions allow the assembly and splicing of an intron fragmented within domain IV <italic>in vitro</italic>, even if no base pairing can take place between the two intron fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, the fragments of some group II introns that became fragmented by genome rearrangements in organelles have the capacity to re-assemble and splice accurately <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). This phenomenon, known as trans-splicing, ligates exons expressed on two separate transcripts. Most fragmented group II introns are found interrupted within domain IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). When these introns harbour an IEP within domain IV, the fragmentation site is located either upstream or downstream from the ORF. There are two examples of group II introns fragmented within domain III; they are found in the chloroplastic genomes of the liverwort <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic> and the tobacco plant <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In addition, two tripartite group II introns, i.e. introns fragmented into three pieces, have been reported to functionally trans-splice in their respective hosts. The first example ligates exons 1 and 2 of the <italic>psaA</italic> chloroplast gene of the green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The second example joins exons c and d of the <italic>nad5</italic> subunit gene in mitochondria of the angiosperm plant <italic>Oenothera berteriana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). These tripartite introns are both fragmented in domain I upstream of the EBS regions and in domain IV, which, in both cases, do not appear to contain an ORF.</p><p>The discovery of group II introns in bacteria greatly facilitated the study of their splicing and mobility pathways. One of the best characterized bacterial group II introns is Ll.LtrB, a 2.5-kb intron found in the low G + C Gram-positive bacterium <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>. It was the first bacterial group II intron shown to splice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and mobilize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) <italic>in vivo</italic>. The splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18">15&#x02013;18</xref>) and mobility pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21 B22">19&#x02013;22</xref>) of this intron have been extensively studied <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Ll.LtrB harbours an ORF in domain IV coding for a 599 amino acid protein, LtrA, with three enzymatic activities: reverse transcriptase, maturase and endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The maturase activity of LtrA is essential to promote intron splicing by assisting the folding of this large ribozyme into its catalytically active conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). LtrA binds the intron RNA primarily at a distinctive structure found in domain IVa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, DIVa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). By binding to this structural motif, the IEP occludes its own Shine&#x02013;Dalgarno sequence and autoregulates its translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>The Ll.LtrB group II intron is found in three conjugative elements from <italic>L. lactis</italic>: the pRS01 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and pAH90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) plasmids, and the <italic>L. lactis</italic> 712 sex factor, an integrative and conjugative element closely related to pRS01 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Interestingly, in all three cases, the intron interrupts the gene coding for a putative relaxase at the same position. The relaxase enzyme is essential for conjugation; it initiates DNA transfer by inflicting a site and strand-specific nick at the origin of transfer (<italic>oriT&#x02009;</italic>) of the conjugative element. Then, the enzyme carries one DNA strand to the recipient cell by rolling-circle replication via the mating pore, and re-ligates the ends of the conjugated element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>Since the relaxase enzyme is essential for conjugation, splicing of Ll.LtrB is a prerequisite for the intercellular transfer of its host elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Klein and colleagues showed that the intimate relationship between splicing and conjugation can be exploited to monitor splicing of Ll.LtrB. They confirmed by real-time RT-PCR analyses that the conjugation efficiency of a mobilizable plasmid is directly proportional to splicing of Ll.LtrB from the relaxase transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we use the Ll.LtrB intron from <italic>L. lactis</italic> as a model system to study group II intron trans-splicing in bacteria. We developed a splicing/conjugation assay that measures Ll.LtrB splicing efficiency by monitoring sex factor conjugation levels. We used this splicing/conjugation assay to investigate trans-splicing of the lactococcal intron. When fragmented at analogous locations to various naturally occurring fragmentation sites, Ll.LtrB consistently shows the ability to splice <italic>in trans</italic>, sometimes at very high efficiencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LtrA protein is essential for trans-splicing. These findings constitute the first demonstration and characterization of trans-splicing of a group II intron in bacteria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p><italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> strains NZ9800&#x00394;<italic>ltrB</italic>::<italic>tet</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and LM0231 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) were grown at 30&#x000b0;C without shaking in M17 media supplemented with 0.5% glucose (GM17). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain DH10&#x003b2; was used for cloning and was grown at 37&#x000b0;C by shaking in LB broth.

When the oligonucleotides for P<sub>23</sub> left were designed, a BssHII cloning site was introduced 6 nucleotides downstream of the transcription initiation site (Supplementary Table S1, P<sub>23</sub> left top/bottom). Similarly, a NotI cloning site was introduced at the +6 position of P<sub>23</sub> right (Supplementary Table S1, P<sub>23</sub> right top/bottom). These two unique restriction sites were subsequently used to clone the various relaxase fragments.

When the relaxase-deleted sex factor is thereby complemented, transfer efficiency is restored from 1.88 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> to 5.80 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, SF&#x00394;<italic>ltrB</italic>/pDL-P<sub>23</sub><sup>2</sup>-<italic>ltrB</italic>). The difference in transfer efficiency between the complemented (5.80 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) and the wild-type sex factor (7.33 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>) (&#x0223c;8-fold) is likely due to overexpression of the relaxase gene from a constitutive promoter on a multiple copy plasmid. Notably, the relaxase transcript produced from the wild-type chromosomal sex factor is undetectable by northern blot. On the other hand, expression from the P<sub>23</sub> promoter produces high levels of both the full-length relaxase transcript and mature mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, compare lanes NZ9800 and <italic>ltrB</italic>-WT in both blots). Accordingly, significantly less ligated exons and no intron lariats are detected by RT-PCR in NZ9800, where the chromosomal sex factor expresses a functional relaxase, compared to expression of the relaxase gene from the P<sub>23</sub> promoter (see below, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B and C, cf. NZ9800 and <italic>ltrB</italic>-WT). Western blot analysis confirms the significant increase in LtrB production from the plasmid when compared to its expression from the chromosomal sex factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, cf. NZ9800 and <italic>ltrB</italic>-WT). Since no signal for LtrB is detected from NZ9800, the increase in LtrB expression from the P<sub>23</sub> promoter was estimated to be of at least 112-fold. Therefore, the slight increase in conjugation efficiency between the wild-type and complemented sex factor (&#x0223c;8-fold) is not comparable to the great difference in levels of relaxase expression observed (at least 112-fold). The complementation system is thus most likely saturated in relaxase enzyme, and the maximal rate of sex factor conjugation efficiency is probably reached (10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> range). This suggests that the conjugation efficiency observed for the complemented sex factor underestimates the real splicing efficiency of Ll.LtrB. Therefore, the conjugation efficiencies observed throughout this study will be interpreted as increases from the background level rather than decreases from the saturated maximum level.

Accordingly, neither ligated exons nor excised intron lariats were detected by RT-PCR analyses (see below, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B and C respectively). Taken together, these results demonstrate that transfer of the <italic>L. lactis</italic> sex factor is dependent on Ll.LtrB splicing from the relaxase transcript. We have therefore built a highly sensitive splicing/conjugation assay (10<sup>7</sup>-fold detection range) to monitor Ll.LtrB splicing in <italic>L. lactis</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Trans-splicing of Ll.LtrB fragmented within domain IV</title><p>We used the above splicing/conjugation assay to assess if Ll.LtrB is capable of splicing when severed into two fragments at various positions. Several locations were chosen to mimic fragmentation sites found in naturally occurring trans-splicing group II introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, S1&#x02013;S5). To introduce a fragmentation site within Ll.LtrB (Sn, n varies from 1 to 5), the complete relaxase gene was PCR-amplified as two non-overlapping fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). To ensure equimolar production of each relaxase fragment, these were expressed from two constitutive P<sub>23</sub> promoters located on the same plasmid, pDL- P<sub>23</sub><sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). The two promoters were cloned in opposite orientation to ensure that two independent RNA transcripts are generated. Proper expression of relaxase fragments was assessed by northern blot analyses and all the transcripts displayed the expected size. However, the fragments expressed from the P<sub>23</sub>-right promoter, consisting of exon 1 and the first portion of the Ll.LtrB intron, invariably showed slightly higher expression level than those expressed from the P<sub>23</sub>-left promoter, corresponding to the second portion of Ll.LtrB and exon 2 (data not shown). The lower expression of the 3&#x02032; relaxase fragments is likely due to their instability since transcription of these fragments is initiated at different positions within Ll.LtrB. This probably leads to a slight underestimation of the Ll.LtrB trans-splicing efficiency.</p><p>Most trans-splicing group II introns are found fragmented within domain IV. When these introns harbour an ORF, the fragmentation site can be found either upstream or downstream of the ORF. Therefore, we investigated the effect of fragmenting Ll.LtrB in domain IV, either upstream or downstream of the <italic>ltrA</italic> ORF. Two sites were chosen for fragmentation upstream of the ORF. The first site lies at the bottom of the DIV stem (position 524, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, S1). Fragmentation of Ll.LtrB at this location does not allow base pairing interactions between the two intron RNA pieces, but leaves only a series of long-range tertiary interactions for intron fragment recognition and assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, greek letters). The second site lies within the DIVa stem at position 543 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, S2). According to the potential tertiary contacts between the two Ll.LtrB fragments, this fragmentation site is equivalent to S1. However, S2 also allows a potential 16 base pair interaction between the two intron pieces. When the intron is fragmented at the S1 site, the relaxase can promote sex factor conjugation to an efficiency of 1.66 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>, &#x0223c;890-fold over the background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, S1). This shows that tertiary interactions are sufficient to promote intron fragment assembly and splicing. On the other hand, when the relaxase is fragmented at the S2 site, sex factor conjugation is &#x0223c;87 times more efficient than S1, &#x0223c;76&#x02009;000-fold over the background (1.44 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, S2). These results suggest that base pairing interactions between intron fragments further stimulate their assembly and splicing <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Even though the potential tertiary interactions between the two intron pieces are the same as with S1 and S2, this Ll.LtrB trans-splicing variant harbours <italic>ltrA</italic> and the high affinity LtrA binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, DIVa) on the 5&#x02032; instead of the 3&#x02032; intron fragment. The relaxase gene fragmented at the S3 site promoted sex factor conjugation to very high levels (1.16 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, S3, two fragments), &#x0223c;6.17 million-fold over the background (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, SF&#x00394;<italic>ltrB</italic>/pDL-P<sub>23</sub><sup>2</sup>).

Therefore, expression of both relaxase fragments is absolutely required to promote sex factor conjugation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that when the Ll.LtrB intron is fragmented independently at three different positions within domain IV, a significant proportion of the two intron fragments can fold correctly, assemble and trans-splice to ligate their flanking exons.</p></sec><sec><title>Trans-splicing of Ll.LtrB fragmented at other naturally occurring group II intron fragmentation sites</title><p>Fragmentation sites outside domain IV can be found in domains I or III in some group II introns.

The fragmentation site was introduced at position 172 upstream of the EBS1 and 2 sequences. When Ll.LtrB is fragmented at this position, the possible tertiary interactions contributing to intron fragment assembly are different from those of the previous fragmentation sites (S1&#x02013;S3). Moreover, a potential 19 base pair interaction can take place between the two fragments of the intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, S4). When the two relaxase fragments are expressed independently, no significant increase in conjugation efficiency is observed (10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> range) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, S4, 5&#x02032; fragment and 3&#x02032; fragment). However, when both fragments are co-expressed, the rate of sex factor conjugation increases to 4.52 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, S4, two fragments). The substantial increase observed (&#x0223c;240&#x02009;000-fold) in sex factor transfer efficiency from basal level when both relaxase fragments are produced demonstrates that Ll.LtrB can also trans-splice when fragmented in domain I at this position.</p><p>The last fragmentation site engineered in Ll.LtrB lies in the loop region of domain III at position 499 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, S5) and mimics the fragmentation site of the <italic>rps12</italic> intron in <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> and <italic>N. tabacum</italic> chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).

Using a similar approach, we designed an RT-PCR assay to detect the trans-spliced Y-shaped intron molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, bottom). This assay was designed to yield a 201-bp fragment when a lariat or a Y-shaped intron molecule is produced. The two RT-PCR primers lie outside of the region where the fragmentation sites were engineered, and could thus be used with all fragmented relaxase variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, bottom, black arrows). The assay was performed on total RNA extracted from donor cells (NZ9800&#x00394;<italic>ltrB</italic>) containing various Ll.LtrB constructs.

On the other hand, Y-branched intron molecules are only detected with the most efficient trans-splicing construct, where the intron is fragmented downstream of the ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, S3, two fragments). Failure to detect Y-branched introns from the other fragmented variants of Ll.LtrB is most likely due to the low level of these molecules as well as their instability. Indeed, Y-shaped molecules have three free ends and are more likely sensitive to degradation than intron lariats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, bottom).</p><p>The presence of ligated exons of the relaxase gene was also assessed by RT-PCR.

As can be seen in the agarose gel presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, ligated exons are detected in total RNA extracted from all donor cells containing Ll.LtrB constructs that showed conjugation efficiencies above background. Specifically, ligated exons are detected in the case of the full-length <italic>ltrB</italic> gene but not from the catalytically inactive <italic>ltrB</italic>-&#x00394;D5 variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, <italic>ltrB</italic>-WT and <italic>ltrB</italic>-&#x00394;D5). Ligated exons are also detected in all five cases of Ll.LtrB trans-splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, S1&#x02013;S5). Sequence analyses of all RT-PCR products confirmed that the exons were ligated precisely at the intron splice junctions. These RT-PCR assays confirm that in all cases where sex factor conjugation increased over the background, properly ligated relaxase exons were readily detectable in donor cells. Furthermore, Y-branched intron molecules could be detected only for the fragmented relaxase construct that sustains the highest conjugation efficiency (S3).</p></sec><sec><title>The LtrA protein is essential for trans-splicing of Ll.LtrB</title><p>Splicing of group II introns <italic>in vivo</italic> requires the assistance of splicing co-factors that function as maturases to stabilize the catalytically active intron structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Some group II introns, like Ll.LtrB, encode their own maturase. The role of IEPs in trans-splicing has never been investigated.</p><p>To assess the role of the LtrA protein in Ll.LtrB trans-splicing, we studied two different protein mutants. First, the Ll.LtrB-Mat<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutant carries point mutations that only affect the maturase activity of LtrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Second, the Ll.LtrB-&#x00394;ORF intron carries a deletion of 88% of the <italic>ltrA</italic> coding sequence, which completely removes the maturase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>Cis-splicing of these Ll.LtrB mutants was first analysed in our splicing/conjugation assay. As expected, the Ll.LtrB-&#x00394;ORF mutant appears completely inactive. When the relaxase gene harbours this intron mutant, sex factor conjugation efficiency is only 10-fold higher than the background (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, cf. SF&#x00394;<italic>ltrB</italic>/pDL-P<sub>23</sub><sup>2</sup>-<italic>ltrB</italic> &#x00394;ORF and SF&#x00394;<italic>ltrB</italic>/pDL-P<sub>23</sub><sup>2</sup>). Surprisingly, the maturase mutant efficiently induced sex factor transfer to a level &#x0223c;152&#x02009;000-fold over the background (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, cf. SF&#x00394;<italic>ltrB</italic>/pDL-P<sub>23</sub><sup>2</sup>-<italic>ltrB</italic> Mat<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and SF&#x00394;<italic>ltrB</italic>/pDL-P<sub>23</sub><sup>2</sup>). Such a result suggests that this LtrA mutant can still bind and promote Ll.LtrB splicing.</p><p>Next, the two LtrA mutants were analysed in the context of two fragmented introns: the S4 variant fragmented within domain I, and the S3 variant fragmented downstream of the ORF within domain IV. These two introns were chosen because they trans-splice efficiently and are fragmented in different domains (DI versus DIV). The intron fragment that is bound by the LtrA protein also differs in these two variants. Indeed, when the intron is fragmented within domain I (S4), the LtrA primary-binding site (stem DIVa, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) lies in the 3&#x02032; fragment of the intron. On the other hand, when the fragmentation site is located downstream of the ORF (S3), the LtrA primary binding site lies in the 5&#x02032; fragment of the intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, the introduction of point mutations, that only abolish the maturase activity of LtrA to both fragmented introns, caused a consistent decrease of &#x0223c;35&#x02009;000-fold in sex factor conjugation efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, S4 and S3, two fragments/Mat<sup>&#x02212;</sup>). Moreover, removal of the ORF from Ll.LtrB completely abolishes trans-splicing as the sex factor conjugation efficiency drops to background levels with both variants tested (10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, S3 and S4, two fragments/&#x00394;ORF). Interestingly, if a second plasmid overexpressing LtrA (pLE-P<sub>23</sub><sup>2</sup>-<italic>ltrA</italic>) is introduced into cells harbouring the &#x00394;ORF variants of fragmented Ll.LtrB, conjugation efficiency is almost completely restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, S3 and S4, two fragments/&#x00394;ORF + ORF). This increase in sex factor conjugation efficiency is not a direct effect of LtrA on the sex factor since the LtrA-expressing plasmid alone does not sustain conjugation of the sex factor (1.31 &#x000b1; 0.85 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>). These results demonstrate that the LtrA protein, primarily through its maturase function, is an essential co-factor for Ll.LtrB trans-splicing in <italic>L. lactis</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we describe a highly sensitive conjugation-based system to monitor splicing of the Ll.LtrB group II intron in <italic>L. lactis</italic>. One of the important features of this experimental system lies in its extremely broad detection range. This simple genetic assay allows the detection and study of Ll.LtrB splicing quantitatively on a 10<sup>7</sup>-fold detection range. As we demonstrate in this study, the Ll.LtrB splicing/conjugation assay will be particularly useful to study group II intron trans-splicing, an aspect of group II intron splicing that is not very well studied or understood.</p><p>Although this genetic assay was developed to study Ll.LtrB trans-splicing, some interesting facts regarding sex factor conjugation and Ll.LtrB cis-splicing were discovered. First, we observe that expressing higher amounts of the relaxase enzyme increased sex factor conjugation efficiency from 7.33 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) to 5.80 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Our data show that the sex factor conjugation machinery can sustain even higher transfer rates than what is observed with the wild-type element. This demonstrates that the presence of Ll.LtrB within the relaxase gene not only controls conjugation of the <italic>L. lactis</italic> sex factor, but also that the normal LtrB expression level in NZ9800 is sub-optimal for the sex factor conjugation machinery. This suggests that any mutation within Ll.LtrB that hinders splicing would also directly, and proportionally, reduce LtrB expression and sex factor conjugation efficiency.</p><p>The catalytic domain (DV) of Ll.LtrB was previously deleted to generate a splicing deficient mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). When the relaxase gene contains this Ll.LtrB-&#x00394;D5 variant, the sex factor conjugation efficiency is similar to the background observed when no relaxase is provided <italic>in trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, 3.79 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> versus 1.88 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>). Moreover, no RT-PCR signals for excised intron lariats or ligated exons were obtained for this Ll.LtrB mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B and C). Taken together, these results confirm that deletion of domain V from Ll.LtrB prevents any residual splicing in <italic>L. lactis</italic>.</p><p>When the relaxase gene provided <italic>in trans</italic> is interrupted by the Ll.LtrB maturase-deficient mutant (Ll.LtrB-Mat<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), sex factor conjugation efficiency increases by &#x0223c;152&#x02009;000-fold over the background (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, 2.86 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> versus 1.88 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>). This shows that this LtrA maturase mutant can bind the intron and promote splicing to significant levels. When Ll.LtrB is missing most of the LtrA coding region (Ll.LtrB-&#x025b5;ORF), we observe only a minor increase in sex factor conjugation efficiency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In fact, this increase is comparable to the background conjugation rate obtained upon expression of individual fragments of the relaxase variants fragmented at position S3 and S4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, S3/5&#x02032; fragment and 3&#x02032; fragment, S4/5&#x02032; fragment and 3&#x02032; fragment). Conjugation efficiencies in the 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> range correspond to only a few transconjugant colonies per assay; very close to the limit of detection of our system.</p><p>Using our splicing/conjugation assay, we report the first experimental evidence that group II introns can trans-splice in bacteria. All the naturally occurring group II intron fragmentation sites were independently engineered within Ll.LtrB: three sites located in domain IV, two upstream and one downstream of the ORF, and one site located in both domains I and III. The trans-splicing efficiency of Ll.LtrB was found to vary greatly with the location of the fragmentation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Considering the limited number of characterized trans-splicing introns and the lack of similarity between these introns and Ll.LtrB, it was surprising to detect trans-splicing with all fragmented variants of the lactococcal intron. The fragmentation site we engineered in domain I was actually never found as a unique fragmentation site. It was only observed in nature in conjunction with a second fragmentation within domain IV in two tripartite group II introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Nevertheless, when fragmented at this location within domain I, Ll.LtrB trans-splices efficiently since the sex factor conjugation is &#x0223c;240&#x02009;000-fold higher than the background.</p><p>In domain IV, two different intron fragmentation sites upstream of the <italic>ltrA</italic> coding region were studied. When the intron is fragmented at position S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), the trans-splicing efficiency is the lowest observed (1.66 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, S1). Due to the position of the fragmentation site, at the bottom of the DIV stem, the two intron fragments cannot interact by base pairing but only through long-range tertiary interactions. However, when the intron is fragmented at a position only 19&#x02009;nt downstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, S2), the two intron fragments potentially have an additional 16&#x02009;nt base pair interaction. In this case, sex factor conjugation increases by &#x0223c;100-fold (1.44 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, S2). This finding suggests that base pairing between intron fragments plays an important role in intron assembly and splicing <italic>in vivo</italic>, contrary to what was previously proposed from <italic>in vitro</italic> data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Notably, the intron fragments of the vast majority of fragmented group II introns reported kept the potential to interact by a series of base pairs. Even though long range tertiary interactions are expected to be key in the assembly of folded group II intron fragments, it is conceivable that base pairing plays also a role in the assembly of fragmented group II introns at physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>The trans-splicing efficiency of Ll.LtrB is greater when the fragmentation in domain IV occurs downstream rather than upstream from the ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, cf. S3/two fragments to both S1 and S2). A reason for this difference may be that interrupting Ll.LtrB upstream of its ORF can disrupt the DIVa stem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), which is the primary binding site for LtrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Since we showed that the LtrA protein is absolutely necessary for the trans-splicing reaction, it is likely that disruption of its primary interaction site within the intron RNA will decrease trans-splicing efficiency. Therefore, it would be difficult to generalize that group II introns trans-splice more efficiently when fragmented downstream rather than upstream from their carried ORFs within domain IV. Interestingly, a thorough comparative analysis by Qiu and Palmer showed that a mitochondrial group II intron in angiosperms, <italic>nad1i</italic>728, underwent fifteen independent incidences of fragmentation within domain IV throughout differentiation of these species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Among these cases, ten independent fragmentation events occurred upstream of the intron-encoded <italic>matR</italic> gene while only five occurred downstream. However, the authors did not conclude that fragmentation of a group II intron upstream rather than downstream of its carried ORF enabled better trans-splicing.</p><p>Since Ll.LtrB showed satisfactory trans-splicing efficiencies when fragmented in domain I and IV independently, we assessed the trans-splicing potential of two tripartite Ll.LtrB introns. We combined one fragmentation within domain IV, upstream or downstream of the ORF, with the fragmentation in domain I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, S2 and S4, S3 and S4). These two tripartite variants of Ll.LtrB failed to trans-splice since the sex factor conjugation efficiency observed was in the 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> range, which is comparable to overexpression of independent fragments of the relaxase fragmented at sites S3 and S4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Notably, in chlamydomonas chloroplast, it was shown that at least 9 cellular factors are needed for trans-splicing of the <italic>psaA</italic> tripartite intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). One may imagine that following the fragmentation of a group II intron, the recruitment of splicing factors becomes important in maintaining reasonable splicing efficiency and gene expression.</p><p>Using the intron variants fragmented in domain I (S4) and domain IV downstream of the ORF (S3), we show that the LtrA protein is essential for Ll.LtrB trans-splicing <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Indeed, trans-splicing of these introns is abolished in the absence of LtrA, and is almost completely restored when LtrA is produced <italic>in trans</italic> from a second plasmid. Interestingly, LtrA remains important for the assembly of Ll.LtrB fragments whether its primary binding site (DIVa) rests in the 5&#x02032; or the 3&#x02032; intron fragment. These results suggest that for both of these Ll.LtrB fragmented variants, as well as for the ORF-encoding fragmented introns (S1&#x02013;S5), the LtrA binding structure is correctly folded in a significant proportion of the intron fragments to allow LtrA binding and Ll.LtrB splicing.</p><p>It is well established that the maturase activity of the LtrA protein is essential for Ll.LtrB splicing <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate that the maturase function of LtrA is also extremely important for Ll.LtrB trans-splicing. Using a maturase mutant for the introns fragmented at sites S3 and S4, we observe a significant and consistent drop of &#x0223c;35&#x02009;000-fold in sex factor conjugation efficiency for both constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, cf. S3/two fragments and S4/two fragments and their respective Mat<sup>&#x02212;</sup> counterparts). In our system, it is impossible to use conjugation efficiencies to quantify the difference observed between the cis-splicing full-length intron and its maturase-deficient counterpart since conjugation is saturated when the full-length <italic>ltrB</italic> gene is overexpressed. Yet, one may expect that the assistance of the maturase function of LtrA is more important for bimolecular splicing reactions than for cis-splicing.</p><p>We demonstrated that a bacterial group II intron can trans-splice efficiently <italic>in vivo</italic> when fragmented at different positions. Although several splicing-competent fragmented introns were identified in organellar genomes, no trans-splicing group II intron was yet discovered in bacteria. Fragmentation of group II introns through genome rearrangements may occur more readily in organelles than in bacteria. Indeed, numerous trans-splicing group II introns were found in the mitochondrial genomes of higher plants, which are more plastic and subjected to high rearrangement rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Nevertheless, this study suggests that trans-splicing group II introns may exist and eventually be uncovered in prokaryotes. Group II introns can splice <italic>in trans</italic> in bacterial cells and therefore could be maintained if ever generated.</p></sec>
