We report the structure of the mating type (MT) locus and its evolutionary history in the green seaweed <italic>Ulva partita</italic>, which is a multicellular organism with an isomorphic haploid-diploid life cycle and mating type determination in the haploid phase. Comprehensive comparison of a total of 12.0 and 16.6&#x02009;Gb of genomic next-generation sequencing data for mt<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and mt<sup>+</sup> strains identified highly rearranged MT loci of 1.0 and 1.5&#x02009;Mb in size and containing 46 and 67 genes, respectively, including 23 gametologs. Molecular evolutionary analyses suggested that the MT loci diverged over a prolonged period in the individual mating types after their establishment in an ancestor. A gene encoding an RWP-RK domain-containing protein was found in the mt<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MT locus but was not an ortholog of the chlorophycean mating type determination gene <italic>MID</italic>. Taken together, our results suggest that the genomic structure and its evolutionary history in the <italic>U</italic>. <italic>partita</italic> MT locus are similar to those on other UV chromosomes and that the MT locus genes are quite different from those of Chlorophyceae.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Sexual reproduction systems in eukaryotes can be divided into two types, in terms of determining sex/mating type in the haploid phase (UV systems) or in the diploid phase (XY/ZW systems)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In the XY/ZW systems of mammals, insects, and plants, the structures of XY/ZW chromosomes and their evolution correspond reasonably well with predictions based on population genetics theory, whereby the suppressed recombination of the two chromosomes results in degeneration through Muller&#x02019;s ratchet, background selection, the Hill-Robertson effect with weak selection, and the &#x0201c;hitchhiking&#x0201d; of deleterious alleles along with favorable mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. These theoretical predictions are constructed under the postulate that both sex chromosomes (XY or ZW) are heterozygous in the diploid phase and that they are distributed separately into the gametes (egg and sperm) via meiosis. In this case, deleterious mutations in an allelic gene on a sex chromosome, referred to as a gametolog, are masked by the counterpart gene on the other sex chromosome, resulting in sex chromosome degeneration driven by the above population genetic mechanisms of gene fixation. Sex chromosomes undergo stepwise degeneration, such as a size decrease, gene loss, accumulation of transposable elements, and decrease in codon bias, at different evolutionary times, resulting in &#x0201c;evolutionary strata&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Several recent studies about plant Y chromosomes suggest that purifying selection influences their degeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. On the other hand, this postulate is not applicable to organisms with UV systems in which mutations in both sex chromosomes, named UV chromosomes, are not sheltered, because they have no allelic counterparts in the dominant haploid phase, leading to the expectation of different evolutionary patterns for UV chromosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Recent simulations of UV systems suggest that the degeneration of sex chromosomes due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations by reduced recombination at mating type (MT) loci or sex-determining regions (SDRs) should be slower than in diploid determination systems because of the absence of masking of these mutations in the haploid phase; their differentiation would be driven by balancing selection, which involves maintenance of allelic genes in a population, to a greater extent than in XY/ZW systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, there have been very few empirical studies of the structure and evolution of UV chromosomes.</p><p id="Par3">In the green plant lineage, the genomic sequences of MT loci and SDRs on UV chromosomes have been reported in four species: the unicellular green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (Chlorophyta), the colonial green alga <italic>Gonium</italic> (Chlorophyta), the multicellular alga <italic>Volvox</italic> (Chlorophyta), and the liverwort <italic>Marchantia</italic> (Marchantiophyta)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The three green algal MT loci and SDRs have been compared along with the evolution of multicellularity and oogamy because these algae evolved from an ancestral unicellular green alga, similar to <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, into <italic>Volvox</italic> with multicellularity and oogamy since least 200 million years ago (Mya)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The sizes of <italic>Volvox</italic> male and female SDRs are over 1.0 and 1.5&#x02009;Mb at the distal ends of the UV chromosomes and contain 70 and 80 genes, respectively, and they are larger than those of the of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and <italic>Gonium</italic> MT loci, which are 200&#x02013;300&#x02009;kb and 360&#x02013;500&#x02009;kb and contain 40&#x02013;41 genes and 24 genes, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Many genes of the <italic>Volvox</italic> SDR are the same as those located inside and outside of the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> MT locus, suggesting that expansion of the MT locus involves the surrounding genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. These green algal MT loci/SDRs show high degrees of gene rearrangement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Other well-studied green lineages include bryophyte species, specifically the liverwort <italic>Marchantia</italic> (Marchantiophyta) and the moss <italic>Ceratodon</italic> (Bryophyta). <italic>Marchantia</italic> has accumulated repeats in sex chromosomes, and gametologs are exposed to purifying selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Although the genomic sequences of <italic>Ceratodon</italic> have not been reported, population genetics and molecular evolutionary approaches indicate that non-recombination of SDRs exposes gametologs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The genomic sequences of the MT loci have been reported in several species outside the green lineages. The brown alga <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> has a non-recombining SDR in which gametologs are exposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In fungi, the filamentous self-fertilized ascomycete <italic>Neurospora tetrasperma</italic> and the anther-smut fungus <italic>Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae</italic> have UV chromosomes called &#x0201c;mating type chromosomes&#x0201d;; both the former and latter show an early stage of MT locus degeneration with two inversions via transposable elements over a 1.2&#x02013;5.3&#x02009;Mb region and a highly divergent MT locus with rearrangement over<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In both cases, degeneration signals, such as transposable element accumulation and relaxed codon bias, are found, but there are no clear evolutionary strata. These studies of the MT locus/SDR sequences provided both similar and contrasting findings (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The similar results included low levels of MT locus/SDR recombination, rearrangement of gametolog locations, exposure of most gametologs to purifying selection, low gene density, and gene loss. The contrasting results were a size range of 200&#x02009;kb to 4&#x02009;Mb, lack of clear strata except in <italic>Ceratodon</italic>, lack of relaxed codon usage bias in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (but this has not been estimated in some species), and lack of accumulation of some transposable elements. The rules governing the generation of these differences are not yet clear.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Life cycles and SDRs/mating type loci. Schematics of the life cycles of organisms are shown, along with the features of UV chromosomes. In XY/ZW systems, the diploid phase dominates, and the haploid phase is degenerate. In these organisms, sex determination occurs in the diploid phase, and a sex chromosome of a particular sex degenerates. In UV systems of multicellular organisms, the diploid saprophyte generates haploid zoospores or spores via meiosis, and mating type or sex is genetically determined by the UV chromosomes. Spores or zoospores with U and V chromosomes are female and male, respectively, and they develop haploid gametophytes. In UV systems of unicellular organisms, diploid zygospores after fusion of gametes with opposite mating types, some of which are dormant, undergo germination and meiosis to generate haploid vegetative cells that reproduce themselves and generate gametes under particular conditions, such as nutrient starvation. Genomic sequences of UV chromosomes are revealed in two types of life cycle: dominating haploid phase (e.g., the multicellular green alga <italic>Volvox</italic> and the moss <italic>Marchantia</italic>) and haploid and diploid phases of equal dominance (e.g., the brown alga <italic>Ectocarpus</italic>). Degeneration of sex chromosomes is thought to be observed only in the moss, with the other organisms harboring sex-determining regions (SDRs) in the UV chromosomes. The green seaweed <italic>Ulva partita</italic> has a life cycle with even domination of haploid and diploid phases, but it is not oogamous, in which gametes differentiate into eggs and sperms. The biflagellate gametes are anisogamous, apart from their size and ultrastructure. <italic>U</italic>. <italic>partita</italic> develops isomorphic gametophytes with a tubular thallus, and somatic cells differentiate into gametes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Gametes of opposite mating types fuse, and a zygote develops into a sporophyte that is identical to a gametophyte in terms of morphology. The sporophyte somatic cells differentiate into zoospores that have four flagellae and are slightly larger than the gametes. The gametes have two mating types, mt<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and mt<sup>+</sup>, defined by the inheritance of chloroplast DNA from the mt<sup>+</sup> gamete to the zygote<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Thus, the sexually reproductive form of this species is the mating type. The other type of MT locus is found in the unicellular green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and the colonial green alga <italic>Gonium</italic>. Their MT locus sizes are smaller than the SDRs in the UV chromosomes, and they have a low diversity of gametologs, which are genes shared between the MT loci of individual mating types.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2017_11677_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e539"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par4">Green seaweeds of the Ulvophyceae are multicellular and grow in coastal areas worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. <italic>Ulva partita</italic> is a species of the Ulvophyceae and shows representative features of the life cycle of this order (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The species exhibits a typical haploid-diploid life cycle with alternating haploid and diploid phases, and the gametes have two mating types, mt<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and mt<sup>+</sup>&#x02009;
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Our previous study indicated a difference between the mating types, as evidenced by the arrangement of a putative mating structure involved in the fusion of gamete cells and an eyespot required for the recognition of photons; the putative mating structure and eyespot are arranged on opposite sides in mt<sup>&#x02212;</sup> gametes and on the same side in mt<sup>+</sup> gametes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The asymmetry between the mating structure and the eye spot is observed even in the isogamous green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Thus, <italic>U</italic>. <italic>partita</italic> develops a multicellular body and produces gametes with the determination of mating types in the haploid phase. <italic>Ulva</italic> species are anisogamous but not oogamous. <italic>U</italic>. <italic>partita</italic> develops isomorphic gametophytes and sporophytes with a thallus (leaf-like) shape, and their somatic cells differentiate into biflagellate gametes and tetraflagellate zoospores, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Compared with the other previously analyzed organisms with UV systems, <italic>U</italic>. <italic>partita</italic> may provide several insights into the drivers of MT locus/SDR evolution in terms of the life cycle. Isomorphism between gametophytes and sporophytes is expected to restrict the functions of the MT locus genes because they must function equally in the haploid gametophyte, haploid gamete, diploid sporophyte, and haploid zoospore. Natural populations of <italic>Ulva</italic> species show no dominance of haploid or diploid phases and no sexual bias between seasons, suggesting that isomorphism and sexuality do not affect fitness in either phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. This is distinct from other organisms. For example, the two mosses develop extremely heteromorphic gametophytes and sporophytes or egg, sperm, and spores, and not all SDR genes are necessarily required for both phases, resulting in evolutionary relaxation of selective pressure on particular genes. <italic>Ulva</italic> genetically determines mating type after meiosis by harboring individual UV chromosomes in gametophytes, and it may acquire a transcriptional regulation system between mating types at the gamete stage or during gametogenesis.</p><p id="Par5">Chlorophyta contains several classes; the major classes are Prasinophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyceae, and Ulvophyceae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In all Chlorophyta, the only known sex- or mating-determining gene is the <italic>Chlamydomonas MID</italic> (<italic><underline>Mi</underline></italic>
<italic>nus dominance</italic>), encoding a putative transcription factor containing an RWP-RK domain, including a leucine zipper-like motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. A <italic>MID</italic> ortholog has been found in the <italic>Volvox</italic> SDR, and its genetic manipulation results in the transformation of sex, from female to male or from male to female. However, the expression level of this gene is constant during spermatogenesis in males, suggesting that this gene does not play a role in sex determination but instead has a male-specific function in the differentiation of male vegetative cells into sperm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. <italic>MID</italic> is highly conserved in the Chlorophyceae lineage, but it is unclear whether other green algal lineages also possess this gene. With regard to green algal evolution, it is of interest to examine the conservation of MID among the distinct taxonomic classes Chlorophyceae and Ulvophyceae.</p><p id="Par6">Here, we report identification of the MT locus in a species with a haploid mating type determination system without oogamy. The primary issue that this study aims to resolve is how much the genomic structures and evolutionary history of the MT locus in <italic>U</italic>. <italic>partita</italic> resemble those of the SDRs in UV chromosomes. The mating type determination system of <italic>U</italic>. <italic>partita</italic> is similar to the UV system in terms of the timing of mating determination, while the genes on the MT locus of the two mating types coexist in the diploid phase over a longer time scale. The isomorphism between the gametophyte in the haploid stage and the sporophyte in the diploid stage may affect the evolution of the MT locus.
