However, no <italic>ChlM</italic> gene has yet been identified and studied in monocotyledonous plants. In this study, a spontaneous mutant, <italic>yellow-green leaf 18</italic> (<italic>ygl18</italic>), was isolated from rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>). This mutant showed yellow-green leaves, decreased chlorophyll level, and climate-dependent growth differences. Map-based cloning of this mutant identified the <italic>YGL18</italic> gene LOC_Os06g04150. <italic>YGL18</italic> is expressed in green tissues, especially in leaf organs, where it functions in chloroplasts. YGL18 showed an amino-acid sequence similarity to that of ChlM from different photosynthetic organisms. <italic>In vitro</italic> enzymatic assays demonstrated that YGL18 performed ChlM enzymatic activity, but ygl18 had nearly lost all ChlM activity. Correspondingly, the substrate MgP was largely accumulated while the product MgPME was reduced in <italic>ygl18</italic> leaves. <italic>YGL18</italic> is required for light-dependent and photoperiod-regulated chlorophyll synthesis. The retarded growth of <italic>ygl18</italic> mutant plants was caused by the high light intensity. Moreover, the higher light intensity and longer exposure in high light intensity even made the <italic>ygl18</italic> plants be more susceptible to death. Based on these results, it is suggested that <italic>YGL18</italic> plays essential roles in light-related chlorophyll synthesis and light intensity&#x02013;involved plant growth.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chlorophyll synthesis</kwd><kwd>light intensity</kwd><kwd>magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase (ChlM)</kwd><kwd>photoperiod</kwd><kwd>plant growth</kwd><kwd>rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>)</kwd><kwd><italic>yellow-green leaf 18</italic> (<italic>ygl18</italic>)</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="11"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="36"/><page-count count="18"/><word-count count="9689"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chlorophyll is the main component of the photosynthetic pigments found in plants, algae and cyanobacteria (Czarnecki and Grimm, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Chlorophyll is extremely important in photosynthesis because of its essential roles in harvesting light energy to form chemical energy (Grossman et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Fromme et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>).</p><p>Chlorophyll synthesis from glutamyl-tRNA to chlorophyll <italic>b</italic> requires a 15-step of enzymatic reaction, and all 27 genes encoding these 15 enzymes have been identified in higher plants represented by Arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>) (Beale, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Nagata et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). However, only 10 genes encoding seven enzymes in the chlorophyll synthesis pathway have been identified in rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>). Coproporphyrinogen III oxidase converts coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX. <italic>RLIN1</italic>, encoding a putative coproporphyrinogen III oxidase in rice, was cloned from a lesion mimic mutant (Sun et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Magnesium chelatase consists of three subunits (ChlH, ChlI, and ChlD) and it catalyzes the formation of Mg-protoporphyrin IX from protoporphyrin IX. <italic>OsChlH</italic> was identified via a T-DNA insertional mutant that had the chlorina and lethal phenotype (Jung et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The <italic>OsChlD</italic> and <italic>OsChlI</italic> genes were cloned from the spontaneous chlorina mutants, <italic>chl1</italic> and <italic>chl9</italic>, respectively (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). <italic>OsChlD</italic> was also cloned with the spontaneous yellow-green leaf mutant <italic>ygl7</italic>, and the RNAi plants of <italic>OsChlD</italic> were found to have a lethal phenotype (Deng et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). <italic>OsCRD1</italic> encodes Mg-Protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester cyclase, transforming magnesium protoporphyrin IX monomethylester (MgPME) into divinyl protochlorophyllide. <italic>OsCRD1</italic> was cloned by using a pale-green leaf mutant <italic>m167</italic> and a yellow leaf mutant <italic>yl-1</italic>, and found to have a dual role in chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis capacity (Sheng et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase catalyzes the photoreduction of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide. <italic>OsPORB</italic>, encoding the NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase B, was cloned by using the faded green leaf mutant <italic>fgl</italic>, and it was found essential for chlorophyll synthesis under high light conditions (Sakuraba et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). <italic>OsDVR</italic> encodes the divinyl reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of divinyl chlorophyll(ide) <italic>a</italic> to monovinyl chlorophyll(ide) <italic>a</italic>; <italic>OsDVR</italic> was cloned by using the spontaneous yellow-green leaf mutant <italic>824ys</italic> (Wang et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Chlorophyll synthase catalyzes the esterification of chlorophyllide to form chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>, and <italic>YGL1</italic>, encoding the chlorophyll synthase, has been cloned with the chlorophyll-deficient mutant <italic>ygl1</italic> (Wu et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Chlorophyll <italic>b</italic> is synthesized from chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> by chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> oxygenase; both <italic>OsCAO1</italic> and <italic>OsCAO2</italic> genes were identified to encode the chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> oxygenase; the <italic>Tos17</italic> insertion mutant of <italic>OsCAO1</italic> showed a pale green leaf phenotype, but the insertion mutant of <italic>OsCAO2</italic> was similar to the wild type (Lee et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). <italic>OsCAO1</italic> was also identified through the pale green leaf mutant <italic>pgl</italic>, impacting leaf senescence and thus indirectly affecting grain yield and quality (Yang et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>Magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase (ChlM) is another key enzyme in the chlorophyll synthesis pathway. The <italic>ChlM</italic> gene has been identified and studied in several species. Through cDNA cloning and protein expression, the enzymatic kinetics of the ChlM in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC6803 have been elaborately studied: it catalyzes the methyl transfer from the common methyl donor <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the carboxyl group of the C13 propionate side chain of magnesium protoporphyrin IX (MgP), enabling the formation of MgPME and <italic>S</italic>-adenosylhomocysteine (Shepherd et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Shepherd and Hunter, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The structure of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> ChlM has also been analyzed to illustrate its catalytic mechanism (Chen et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Two <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> mutants defective in <italic>ChlM</italic> were identified; both were yellow in the dark and dim light, and their growth was inhibited under higher light intensities (Meinecke et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>), <italic>ChlM</italic> cDNA was cloned to study its enzymatic function, and ChlM was found to interact with the ChlH subunit of Mg chelatase (Alawady et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Inhibited and excessive expression of tobacco <italic>ChlM</italic> revealed its functions involved in the inverse activation of protoheme and Mg porphyrin synthesis (Alawady and Grimm, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the <italic>ChlM</italic> gene was identified by cDNA cloning and the ChlM enzymatic activity was verified <italic>in vitro</italic> (Block et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). In addition, an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> knock-out mutant of the <italic>ChlM</italic> gene showed that this gene is essential to form chlorophyll and subsequently for the formation of photosystem complexes (Pontier et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Recently, it was proposed that ChlM was regulated by the NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase C on the redox status of conserved cysteine residues of ChlM (Richter et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Further research has showed that three conserved cysteines are essential for the activity and redox regulation of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ChlM (Richter et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). A study of the pea plant (<italic>Pisum sativum</italic>) revealed that the ChlM activity is dependent on its folate status (Van Wilder et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). However, no <italic>ChlM</italic> gene has yet been identified and studied in monocotyledonous plants.</p><p>This study performed a map-based cloning of the <italic>yellow-green leaf 18 (ygl18)</italic> locus in rice. Doing so revealed that <italic>ygl18</italic> harbored a single-base substitution in the <italic>OsChlM</italic> gene, resulting in a single amino acid change in the protein. The ChlM activity of YGL18 was checked, while ygl18 was attenuated on the enzymatic function, leading to the accumulation of MgP and the reduction of MgPME in the <italic>ygl18</italic> mutant. On the basis of the phenotypic and molecular characterization of <italic>ygl18, YGL18</italic> is proposed to play multiple yet important roles in chlorophyll synthesis and plant growth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>The <italic>ygl18</italic> mutant was isolated from the rice cultivar &#x0201c;Guangzhan63S&#x0201d; (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L. subsp. <italic>indica</italic>), and its yellow-green leaf phenotype was stably inherited.

It would be interesting to know the reason for this growth difference. Under natural field conditions, a longer day length, higher temperature and higher solar radiation occurred at the planting time in Wuhan than in Lingshui (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM11">S6</xref>). Accordingly, we explored the growth status of the wild-type and <italic>ygl18</italic> plants under different experimental conditions in the plant growth chamber. When the wild-type and <italic>ygl18</italic> plants were cultivated under a 14-h light condition (190 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 26/19&#x000b0;C for light/dark), mimicking the day length in Wuhan, the <italic>ygl18</italic> mutant grew to a similar height as the wild type (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10A,B</xref>). Based on this growth condition, the growth temperature was further raised to 31/22&#x000b0;C and 35/22&#x000b0;C (14-h light, 190 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), but the <italic>ygl18</italic> plants maintained equivalent growth with the wild type (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10C&#x02013;F</xref>). Next, we tried to enhance the light intensity.

The recombinant YGL18 protein expressed in E. <italic>coli</italic> was shown to perform ChlM enzymatic activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Therefore, we succeeded in identifying a <italic>ChlM</italic> gene in a monocotyledonous plant.</p></sec><sec><title>The rice YGL18 protein is a functionally conserved ChlM protein, and the substitution of a conserved leu to Phe in ygl18 starkly weakens its function</title><p>The amino acid residues of YGL18 and other ChlM orthologues from different photosynthetic organisms are highly conserved (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These conserved sequences belong to the conserved protein domain &#x0201c;BchM-ChlM&#x0201d; (TIGR02021), which represents the <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine-dependent O-methyltransferase responsible for the methylation of MgP (Marchler-Bauer et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). These conserved amino acid residues may be essential for the ChlM function. A missense mutation of <italic>chlM-1</italic> in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> made these mutants incapable of accumulating chlorophyll (Meinecke et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), where the mutation resulted in a replacement of a leucine (Leu) by a proline (Pro) residue at position 270 in CrChlM, meanwhile, Leu at this particular position remained completely conserved in our analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In this study, the Leu at position 225 in the YGL18 protein is also originally a fully conserved amino acid residue among the analyzed organisms, but it is substituted by Phe in the ygl18 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). It is speculated that this Leu may play an important role for the OsChlM protein function. Previous study has indicated that the amino acid of ChlM proteins corresponding to the Leu at position 225 in the YGL18 protein is involved in binding to the cofactor SAM for ChlM proteins in different organisms (Chen et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In addition, it was recently proposed that the NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase C has a regulatory impact on the redox status of conserved cysteine residues of ChlM, thus altering the ChlM activity (Richter et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Further research has identified three conserved cysteine residues essential for the catalytic function and the redox-dependent activation of the Arabidopsis ChlM (Richter et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). These three cysteine residues are also conserved in the YGL18 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), implying their possible functions on the redox regulation of ChlM enzymatic activity in rice. Interestingly, the third cysteine is just located at the left neighboring site of Leu 225 of YGL18 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), meaning that the Leu at position 225 is also probably involved in redox regulation of ChlM enzymatic activity. Therefore, it is plausible that the amino-acid substitution of Leu to Phe in the ygl18 protein may impact the ChlM activity by changing its binding or catalyzing ability to SAM.</p><p>ChlM catalyzes the formation of MgPME from MgP in the chlorophyll synthesis pathway (Richter et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In this study, the YGL18 protein was also verified to perform the ChlM activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), just as the ChlM proteins do in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC6803 (Shepherd et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Shepherd and Hunter, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Block et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), and tobacco (Alawady et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). This clearly confirms that the <italic>YGL18</italic> gene is the corresponding <italic>ChlM</italic> gene in rice. The <italic>in vitro</italic> assay revealed that the ChlM enzymatic activity of the ygl18 protein was greatly reduced, with the slight synthesis of MgPME from MgP requiring a large amount of the ygl18 protein (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C,D</xref>). Further, given that the MgPME content could be measured in the <italic>ygl18</italic> leaves (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B,C</xref>), this supports the conclusion that the single amino acid exchange from Leu to Phe in ygl18 did not completely negate the protein's biological function. Most possibly, it is just the remained slight activity of the ygl18 protein that results in the characteristics of <italic>ygl18</italic> mutant on chlorophyll synthesis and plant growth, as discussed later.</p></sec><sec><title>The rice <italic>YGL18 (ChlM)</italic> gene is required for light-dependent and photoperiod-regulated chlorophyll synthesis</title><p>The <italic>YGL18</italic> gene is mainly expressed in green tissues, especially in leaves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), where the YGL18 protein is localized in the chloroplasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These results are all consistent with the fact that the <italic>ChlM</italic> gene encodes one of the key enzymes in the chlorophyll synthesis pathway. Among the cloned genes in the chlorophyll synthesis pathway, the <italic>PGL</italic> (<italic>OsCAO1</italic>) gene was identified as required for light-dependent chlorophyll synthesis during the greening of the etiolated plants (Yang et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), but the <italic>FGL</italic> (<italic>OsPORB</italic>) gene was verified as not required for this biological process (Sakuraba et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In this study, the <italic>YGL18</italic> (<italic>ChlM</italic>) gene was clearly essential for light-dependent chlorophyll synthesis during the greening of the etiolated WT and <italic>ygl18</italic> plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Impact of photoperiod on chlorophyll synthesis is rarely reported. More chlorophyll contents were accumulated in the <italic>ygl18</italic> leaves when grown under a longer light application time (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A,B</xref>). Similar phenomena were found from the <italic>chlB</italic> knockout mutant in liverwort (<italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic> L.), where it was suggested that <italic>chlB</italic> was required for chlorophyll biosynthesis under short photoperiod (Ueda et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Nevertheless, there may be a different explanation for this phenomenon in <italic>ygl18</italic>. The ygl18 protein did not completely cancel the protein function, and a large amount of the ygl18 protein could catalyze the formation of a small quantity of MgPME (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). In addition, the circadian expression patterns of the <italic>YGL18</italic> gene revealed that it was up-regulated by light yet down-regulated by dark conditions (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9D&#x02013;G</xref>). As a result, under longer light conditions, the <italic>ygl18</italic> mutant possibly produced more ygl18 proteins for the enzymatic catalyzation, and thus eventually accumulated more chlorophyll in its leaves. Taken together, the results strongly suggested that the <italic>YGL18</italic> (<italic>ChlM</italic>) gene plays an essential role in light-dependent and photoperiod-regulated chlorophyll synthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>The rice <italic>YGL18 (ChlM)</italic> gene is essential for plant growth and survival under high light conditions</title><p>Scarce are studies that pay in-depth attention to the effect on plant growth from functional genes in the chlorophyll synthesis pathway. It was surprising that <italic>ygl18</italic> showed severely retarded growth, and even death, in the paddy field in Wuhan, but near-normal growth in Lingshui (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). When the wild-type and <italic>ygl18</italic> plants were cultivated in the plant growth chamber under different temperature and light conditions, it was the high light intensity, but not the long day length or the high temperature, which impaired the <italic>ygl18</italic> growth (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). Field experiments with different sunlight time and light intensity further showed that the <italic>ygl18</italic> plants were more prone to death under a higher light intensity and a longer exposure time to it (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). Effects of light intensity upon <italic>chlM</italic> mutants have also been reported for other species. In <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, chlM-1</italic> has an amino-acid substitution, while <italic>chlM-2</italic> do not produce the ChlM protein; consequently, <italic>chlM-1</italic> can survive under the light intensity of 45 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, but not under a higher light intensity of 500 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, while <italic>chlM-2</italic> can only weakly survive under 1.6 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of light (Meinecke et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The <italic>Arabidopsis chlM</italic> mutant lacks the <italic>ChlM</italic> mRNA and ChlM protein because of the T-DNA insertion; hence, its mutant seedlings turned white and stopped growing after cotyledon development when germinated under the light intensity of 70 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (Pontier et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Apparently, the complete loss of ChlM function is lethal for plants to grow under well-lit conditions, while an impaired ChlM function makes the plants survival only under low light intensity conditions. Meanwhile, MgP, the substrate of ChlM, notably accumulated in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis chlM</italic> mutants, as described. Similarly, we found that MgP also remarkably accumulated in the rice <italic>ygl18</italic> mutants (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B&#x02013;C</xref>). However, rice mutants, which were related to genes in the chlorophyll synthesis pathway, such as <italic>ygl7</italic> (Deng et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), <italic>ygl1</italic> (Wu et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), and <italic>pgl</italic> (Yang et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), grew only slightly lower than their wild type, and these mutants still contained plenty of chlorophyll thus showed near-green leaves. It was also the fact that the intermediate metabolites of chlorophyll synthesis reportedly did not substantially accumulate (about 2-fold for MgP, and &#x0003c;2-fold for chlide, the substrate of YGL1) in <italic>ygl1</italic> mutants. Considering these studies, it would appear that fluent synthesis of chlorophyll is essential for functional plant growth. The accumulation of the intermediate metabolites, like MgP, is probably the key factor to influence plant growth under high light conditions. When accumulated, such intermediate metabolites may induce oxidative damages under light irradiation, while photoautotrophic growth relying on chlorophyll synthesis may support plant resistance to this damages. It is speculated that a dynamic equilibrium between the damages induced by accumulated MgP and resistance originating from the leaky synthesis of chloroph1yll is critical for the growth of <italic>ygl18</italic> plants. To completely elucidate this scientific issue, a further detailed study will be needed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this study identified the <italic>ChlM</italic> gene in rice plants.
