Structural modifications in the primary cell wall (PCW) are key processes in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. The PCW is a complex dynamic structure that shows spatial and temporal variability in composition and organization. Cell shape, size, and cell-cell adhesion are processes that rely on the coordinated action of enzymes involved in the synthesis, deposition, reorganization and selective disassembly of cell wall components. The ability to selectively modify the wall architecture is a major part of many processes such as cell growth, organ abscission, vascular differentiation, fruit softening and the response to pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The PCW consists primarily of cellulose immersed in a matrix of hemicellulose, pectin, lignin and some structural proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Xyloglucan (XyG) is a well-characterized hemicellulose polysaccharide present in the cell walls of all spermatophytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Xyloglucan has also recently been found in the cell walls of non-vascular and seedless vascular plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. XyG can also be stored as a reserve in cotyledons of many eudicots, such as nasturtium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], <italic>Tamarindus indica </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], <italic>Copaifera langsdorffii </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and <italic>Hymenaea courbaril </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Xyloglucans have a main &#x003b2;-D-(1&#x02192;4)-glucan backbone (denoted as G) generally branched with &#x003b1;(1&#x02192;6)-linked D-xylopyranosyl (denoted as X) or &#x003b2;-D-galactopyranosyl (1&#x02192;2)-D-xylopyranosyl residues (denoted as L).

The archetypical seed XyG of <italic>Tamarindus indica </italic>consists of XXXG, XXLG, XLXG and XLLG in a molar ratio of 1.4:3:1:5.4, respectively. However, these polysaccharides are not identical among plant groups. For example, the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens </italic>and the liverwort <italic>Marchantia polymorpha </italic>synthesize XXGGG- and XXGG-type XyGs, respectively, with side chains that contain a &#x003b2;-D-galactosyluronic acid and a branched xylosyl residue. In contrast, hornworts synthesize XXXG-type XyGs that are structurally homologous to the XyGs synthesized by many seed-bearing and seedless vascular plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>XyG is degraded <italic>in vivo </italic>by five hydrolases: &#x003b2;-galactosidase, &#x003b1;-xylosidase, &#x003b2;-glucosidase, xyloglucan transglycosylase/hydrolase (XTH) and &#x003b1;-fucosidase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]). Although the machinery involved in XyG degradation is relatively well-characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], important details of the biosynthesis of this hemicellulose remain poorly understood. A number of enzymes participate in XyG biosynthesis, including &#x003b2;-(1&#x02192;4)-glucan synthase, &#x003b1;-fucosyltransferases, &#x003b2;-galactosyltransferases and &#x003b1;-xylosyltransferases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]). Recently, only two genes for &#x003b1;-xylosyltransferases (<italic>XXT1 </italic>and <italic>XXT2</italic>) were found to be essential for the biosynthesis of XyG in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The double-mutant <italic>xxt1</italic>/<italic>xxt2 </italic>lacks detectable XyG and has aberrant root hairs, but is viable and has almost normal development. This finding challenges conventional models for the functional organization of PCW components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>An evolutionary analysis of the XyG-related machinery could provide new insights into the origin of this polymer during plant evolution, as well as information on the context in which it occurred. This knowledge could help to explain the role of XyG in plant adaptive features. In this work, we describe a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the multigenic families of glycosyl hydrolases (&#x003b2;-galactosidase, &#x003b1;-xylosidase, &#x003b2;-glucosidase, XTH and &#x003b1;-fucosidase) and transferases (&#x003b2;-(1&#x02192;4)-glucan synthase, &#x003b1;-fucosyltransferases, &#x003b2;-galactosyltransferases and XXT) involved in the biosynthesis, modification and degradation of XyG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Our results indicate that the XyG machinery is present in all embryophytic genomes and possibly emerged from the last common ancestor of the streptophytes (Charophyta algae + embryophytes). This inference suggests that the essential enzymes involved in XyG biosynthesis and turnover originated before land colonization by plants. This conclusion indicates that XyG is more than just a structural and mechanical molecule. Our data also provide additional evidence that streptophyte algae and land plants (Embryophyta) are sister groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Identification and phylogenetic analysis of XyG-related genes in green plant genomes</title><p>In order to identify genes related to XyG synthesis (&#x003b2;-(1&#x02192;4)-glucan synthase, &#x003b1;-fucosyltransferases, &#x003b2;-galactosyltransferases and &#x003b1;-xylosyltransferases) and mobilization/modification (&#x003b2;-galactosidase, &#x003b1;-xylosidase, &#x003b2;-glucosidase, XTH, &#x003b1;-fucosidase; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) in green plants, we used previously characterized protein sequences as queries to perform blast searches using a self-employed algorithm (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>; see Methods for a complete list of the protein sequences used as queries). We also generated a sequence database containing the complete predicted proteomes and transcriptomes for 12 species (Viridiplantae 1.0 containing 365,187 protein sequences and Viridiplantae_nt 1.0 containing 403,380 EST sequences, respectively), including angiosperms (eudicots and monocots), seedless tracheophytes (Lycophyta), non-vascular plants (Bryophyta), and green algae (Chlorophyta). In addition, searches were also run against an EST database (ViridiESTs 1.0 containing 402,770 assembled EST sequences) that included sequences belonging to 29 species from taxonomic groups lacking complete genome information, such as basal and non-eudicot/monocot angiosperms, gymnosperms (Pinophyta, Cycadophyta, Ginkgophyta and Gnetophyta), seedless Tracheophyta (Pterydophyta), non-vascular plants (Marchantiophyta) and Streptophyta algae.</p><p>Using this strategy, we identified 862 XyG-related genes that included 293 XTH sequences, 133 &#x003b2;-galactosidases, 53 &#x003b2;-glucosidases, 24 &#x003b1;-xylosidases, 91 &#x003b2;-(1&#x02192;4)-glucan synthases, 79 &#x003b1;-fucosyltransferases, 108 &#x003b2;-galactosyltransferases and 45 XXTs. We found two evolutionarily unrelated clusters of XyG-related &#x003b1;-fucosidase, one containing 22 sequences homologous to <italic>Arabidopsis ATFXG1 </italic>(At1g67830 - TAIR; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]) and the other containing 14 sequences homologous to <italic>Lilium longiflorum EBM II </italic>(<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BAF85832">BAF85832</ext-link> - GenBank; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]). ESTs with less than 40% of the protein-based query coverage were excluded.</p><p>The relationships between genes can be represented as a system of homologous families that include orthologs and paralogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Orthologs are genes in different species that evolved from a common ancestral gene through speciation whereas paralogs are genes sharing a common ancestral gene that duplicated within the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Orthologs normally retain their original function during evolution whereas paralogs can evolve new functions that may or may not be related to the original one. Consequently, the identification of orthologs is critical for the reliable prediction of gene functions in newly sequenced genomes. This identification is equally important for phylogenetic analysis because interpretable phylogenetic trees can generally be constructed only within sets of orthologs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A complete list of orthologs is also a prerequisite for meaningful comparisons of genome organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The <bold><underline>po</underline></bold>ssible <bold><underline>g</underline></bold>roups of <bold><underline>o</underline></bold>rthologs (PoGOs) were established by using two phylogenetic analyses that involved the amino acid sequences. The first analysis was based on the p-distance (number of differences/number of aligned residues) and PAM 001 matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and used the neighbor-joining tree building method (NJ; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]) while the second analysis was based on the maximum likelihood (ML; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]). We also sought for shared derived ancestral intron positions in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>(eudicot), sorghum (monocot), <italic>Selaginella </italic>(Lycophyte) and <italic>Physcomitrella </italic>(Bryophyte) since this information was useful in inferring the evolutionary relationships between homologous groups. The results for intron positions generally agreed with the phylogenetic analysis (data not shown). This combination of analyses yielded a comprehensive evolutionary profile of the enzymes involved in XyG synthesis and turnover. In the following sections, we present evidence that the complete set of enzymes involved in XyG synthesis and mobilization is present among all embryophytic lineages and that some of them emerged within streptophytes (XTH and &#x003b2;-(1&#x02192;4)-glucan synthase) and chlorophyte algae (&#x003b1;-xylosidase).</p></sec><sec><title>XTH originated in the last common ancestor of streptophytes, before land colonization, and was amplified through several lineage-specific events in embryophytes</title><p>Two hundred and ninety-three XTH homologous sequences were identified among green plants. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences resulted in 21 PoGOs and a group of paralogs among streptophytes (A to V in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>; Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). While no XTH sequence was found among the four complete genomes of green algae (chlorophytes), at least two land plant XTH founder genes were identified in the last common ancestor of streptophytes (PoGOs U and V in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). One of these genes was represented by <italic>CvXTH1 </italic>(previously identified as <italic>Chara2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]) from <italic>Chara vulgaris </italic>(class Charophyceae). This ancestral gene persisted in all streptophyte lineages and was represented by the single PoGO V (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The other founder gene is represented by PoGO U (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), that integrates the <italic>CpXTH1 </italic>gene in the charophyte alga <italic>Closterium peracerosum </italic>(class Zygnemophyceae) and consisted exclusively of XTH sequences from marchantiophyte and streptophyte algae. PoGO U most likely gave rise to 19 PoGOs and a group of paralogs (group K in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These PoGOs and paralogs included all previously reported <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice, and poplar XTH genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]). Since molecular and morphological data suggest that streptophyte algae are sister groups of land plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and since liverworts such as <italic>Marchantia </italic>are the most basal embryophytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], it is plausible that PoGO U-related orthologs have been lost in bryophytes and tracheophytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). PoGO U and the homologous group that emerged from it were defined as Group I while the homologous genes from PoGO V were identified as Group II (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Evolutionary profile of XTH in green plants</bold>.

This conclusion is supported by the detection of XyG in all groups of land plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and the presence of XyG transglycosylation activity in the charophyte alga <italic>Chara vulgaris </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Thus, XTH apparently originated after the divergence of chlorophyte and streptophyte algae. XyG was therefore probably absent in the more ancestral Viridiplantae lineages represented by chlorophyte algae and emerged as a new cell wall component in streptophytes. Since chlorophyte algae occur mainly in salt-water wheres streptophyte algae are mainly fresh-water, we suggest that XyG provided a selective advantage in the colonization of fresh-water habitats. In addition, the ability of XyG to confer mechanical strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] may have been particularly advantageous in allowing streptophytes to colonize terrestrial habitats. Successful land colonization by plants has apparently been limited to a sister lineage of streptophyte algae that gave rise to all embryophyte groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. These conclusions provide additional support for the suggestion that the acquisition of XyG by streptophyte algae was an important factor in land colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>The PoGOs in Group I consisted of genes from all major embryophyte lineages. PoGOs A, F, and O that contained XTH genes from the marchantiophyte <italic>Marchantia polymorpha </italic>(liverwort) and PoGO B that contained bryophyte (moss) XTH genes appeared to have emerged from four genes in the last common ancestor of embryophytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Thus, up to four ancestral XTH genes were related to early non-vascular land plants that were present at least 475 million years ago (based on the current fossil record) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This conclusion supports the notion that gene duplication in the XTH family and its resulting selective advantages is an ancient phenomenon among land plant lineages.</p><p>A striking feature of Group I was the extensive amplification of XTH genes among angiosperms, i.e., 33 genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, 34 in soybean, 35 in poplar, 19 in grape, 30 in rice, and 32 in sorghum, all of which were distributed among 17 PoGOs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However, differential patterns of amplification and/or gene losses were observed among land plants. For instance, PoGOs B, D, and O were present among eudicots but were not detected in monocots (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The presence of bryophyte and lycophyte XTH genes in PoGO B, gymnosperm XTHs in PoGO D, and embryophyte XTH genes in PoGO O indicates that gene losses from these PoGOs occurred specifically in the monocot lineage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). On the other hand, PoGOs G, R, and S were restricted to monocots (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), which suggests that these groups emerged after the divergence of eudicots and monocots. Although the abundance of XTH genes in the rice genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] was initially considered unusual because of the small content of XyG in the PCW of most grasses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], XyG can account for up to 10% of the wall mass in grass tissues during growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and XTH activity may be more important for grasses than previously thought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>PoGO L and the set of paralogs genes that formed Group K were restricted to bryophytes whereas PoGO P was restricted to gymnosperms. The simplest explanation for this is that these lineage-specific acquisitions may be related to functional specialization and/or novelties. These lineage-specific differences suggest that distinct patterns of selective pressure acted on the XTH genes in different lineages, and may partly explain the differential abundance of XyG, i.e., 10-20% of the PCW dry weight in eudicots compared to &#x0003c;5% in graminaceous monocots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]) and the different patterns of XyG substitution and structure, e.g., presence of galacturonic acid in bryophyte and marchantiophyte XyG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>PoGO N contained <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>proteins encoded by <italic>At-XTH31 </italic>and <italic>At-XTH32</italic>, which are involved exclusively in XyG hydrolysis and lack transglycosylation activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. XTH with exclusively hydrolytic activity may have derived from transglycosylating proteins as a new feature of angiosperms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, this conclusion may need to be reevaluated in the light of the data presented here. Indeed, sequences from several taxonomic groups of flowerless seed plants (pinophytes, gnetophytes and cycadophytes; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) were included in PoGO L, suggesting that XTHs with exclusively hydrolytic activity emerged at least in the last common ancestor of the spermatophytes. This inference is further supported by the occurrence of hydrolytic activity in fast growing tissues such as meristems (<italic>Arabidopsis</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]) or during specific developmental stages such as germinating seeds (tomato; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]) or in physiological processes such as the mobilization of endosperm reserves (<italic>Hymenaea courbaril</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]), all of which are key phenomena in seed plants and originated at least 300 million years ago, as suggested by the cycadophytes fossil record [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>The moss <italic>Physcomitrella </italic>genome contained 30 XTH genes, a number comparable to that found in angiosperms (33 in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>and 30 in rice). This elevated number of genes may reflect lineage-specific genome duplications in mosses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Of these 30 genes, 27 were classified in Group I and three in Group II (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), and could be divided into six PoGOs and a paralog group (Group K, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Two of these groups, PoGO L and the paralog group K, were bryophyte-specific while the other five PoGOs (A, B, F, O and V) were shared by tracheophytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). The emergence of these lineage-specific XTH genes in bryophytes could be related to the presence of a specific type of XyG containing &#x003b2;-D-galactosyluronic acid and a branched xylosyl residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] that is not shared with tracheophytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>The vascular seedless <italic>Selaginella </italic>had only 16 XTH genes (14 in Group I and two in Group II) that were divided into seven PoGOs conserved among other tracheophyte lineages (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). All <italic>Selaginella </italic>XTH genes occurred in PoGOs shared by angiosperms. The retention of these genes by angiosperms suggests that the early set of tracheophyte XTH genes was conserved in higher taxa, whereas the basic XyG pattern of XXXG emerged in hornworts and is shared by all tracheophytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The appearance of PoGOs C and E in <italic>Selaginella </italic>suggested that the last common ancestor of tracheophytes carried at least two additional XTH genes when compared to the last common ancestor of embryophytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). If each PoGO shared between different lineages is considered to be representative of founder genes then during their evolution the number of green plant XTHs gradually expanded from two ancestral genes in streptophyte algae to five in early embryophytes (<italic>Physcomitrella </italic>- Bryophyta), seven in early tracheophytes (<italic>Selaginella </italic>- Lycophyta), and 18 in angiosperms (eudicots and monocots). This increasing number of PoGOs suggests an important role for XyG in the evolution from non-vascular land plants to angiosperms.</p><p>The genes in PoGO V have not previously been reported to be XTH, perhaps because the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>lacks genes in this PoGO.

When these fungus sequences were analyzed together with those for XTHs from all groups of plants they formed an outgroup (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The high bootstrap support (86%) suggested a possible single origin for these fungi hydrolases. However, it is unclear whether these fungus genes share a common ancestor with streptophytes XTHs or whether the similarity merely reflects functional convergence from an ancestral eukaryotic glycosyl hydrolase.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b2;-Galactosidase genes are present in eukaryotes and were notably amplified during the evolution of land plants</title><p>One hundred and thirty-three non-redundant &#x003b2;-galactosidase genes were identified in the embryophyte lineages analyzed. These &#x003b2;-galactosidase genes were organized into 10 PoGOs that were divided into two homologous groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>; Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). Group I contained only PoGO J composed of animal, plant and fungus genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>; Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). On the other hand, Group II contained nine PoGOs present exclusively in plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>; Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). The presence in PoGO J of genes from all major eukaryotic lineages suggested that the plant-specific &#x003b2;-galactosidases in Group II must have derived from PoGO J after the divergence of plants from the fungus/animal lineage. PoGO J can therefore be considered to be representative of the ancestral &#x003b2;-galactosidase gene.

Several explanations could account for this scenario. First, the ancestral genes may have survived only in bacteria and streptophytes, having been lost in the fungal/metazoan group and in Viridiplante from chlorophytes. Second, these &#x003b2;-glucosidases could have a bacterial origin and were transmitted horizontally from the ancestral cyanobacterial endosymbiont, which gave rise to chloroplasts, to earlier Viridiplantae, but were specifically lost in chlorophytes. Third, the similarity between the plant XyG-active &#x003b2;-glucosidase and bacterial genes may simply be a case of convergent evolution from distinct ancestral hydrolases.</p></sec><sec><title>Plant &#x003b1;-xylosidase emerged before the divergence between chlorophyte and streptophyte algae and is evolutionarily related to eukaryote &#x003b1;-glucosidases</title><p>At least 24 sequences significantly similar to the well-characterized &#x003b1;-xylosidase <italic>AtXYL1 </italic>from <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>(<italic>At1g68560</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]) and <italic>Tropaeolum majus </italic>(<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CAA10382">CAA10382</ext-link> - GenBank; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]) were identified in the Viridiplantae species (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).

This conclusion may have to be re-evaluated since, as shown here, CSL C included a gene from the streptophyte alga <italic>Chara globularis </italic>(Charophyta), indicating that this group emerged before land colonization by plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). These data raise the interesting possibility that the gene duplication event that resulted in CSL A and CSL C had occurred in early streptophytes. A recent work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] has detected a XyG-like polymer containing glucose and xylose in the streptophyte algae <italic>Spirogyra </italic>(Class Zygnematophyceae).

Although these partially contradictory results indicate that more research is needed to understand the composition of the PCW in streptophyte algae, it seems plausible that the CLS C gene from <italic>C. globularis </italic>could be involved in the synthesis of a XyG-like polymer, as occurs in <italic>Spirogyra</italic>.</p><p>Members of CLS A (<italic>AtCSLA9 </italic>[At5g03760 - PoGO D], <italic>AtCSLA2 </italic>[At5g22740 - PoGO E] and <italic>AtCSLA7 </italic>[At2g35650 - PoGO F]) have &#x003b2;-mannan synthase activity when expressed in S2 <italic>Drosophila </italic>cells supplied with GDP-mannose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Interestingly, the proteins encoded by these three genes were also able to produce &#x003b2;-glucomannan when supplied with GDP-mannose and GDP-glucose, and unexpectedly AtCSLA9 (PoGO D) produced &#x003b2;-glucan when supplied with GDP-glucose; this latter activity is believed to be the main function of CSL C. Thus, it appears that CSL A can synthesize at least three different polymers, &#x003b2;-mannan, &#x003b2;-glucomannan and &#x003b2;-glucan. Conversely, to date, only a single activity (&#x003b2;-glucan synthesis) has been described for CSL C members. These observations raise the question of which activity is performed by the ancestral PoGO H members in chlorophytes. Only mannans, glucoronic acids, mannuronic acids and 3-O-methyl rhamnose have been detected in the cell walls of chlorophytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], thus supporting the view that &#x003b2;-mannan synthase is the basic or primordial activity of the plant CSL A and C ancestral group represented by chlorophyte PoGO H [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. This conclusion further supports the hypothesis that the specific &#x003b2;-glucan synthase activity used in XyG synthesis emerged from mixed activity (&#x003b2;-mannan/&#x003b2;-glucomannan/&#x003b2;-glucan synthase) proteins in the course of streptophyte evolution.</p><p>The CSL C group included five genes from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, poplar and rice, 12 from soybean, four from grape, three from sorghum, two from <italic>Selaginella </italic>and seven from <italic>Physcomitrella</italic>.

PoGO D included <italic>Arabidopsis AtCSLA9</italic>, the protein product of which has important &#x003b2;-mannan synthase activity, as well as &#x003b2;-glucomannan and &#x003b2;-glucan synthase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. PoGO E, which is more closely related to PoGO D, was restricted to angiosperms and included <italic>Arabidopsis AtCSLA2</italic>, which has prevalent &#x003b2;-mannan synthase activity and &#x003b2;-glucomannan synthase activity, but almost no &#x003b2;-glucan synthase activity. PoGO Proto DE, which contained sequences from <italic>Selaginella </italic>and <italic>Physcomitrella</italic>, was considered as an outgroup to PoGOs D and E (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). This finding suggested that PoGOs D, E and Proto DE had a common origin in the last common embryophyte ancestor. PoGO F was restricted to angiosperms and contained <italic>Arabidopsis AtCSLA7</italic>, which has mainly &#x003b2;-mannan synthase activity and lacks &#x003b2;-glucan synthase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. PoGO F had an apparent <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>-specific gene duplication pattern that resulted in seven paralogs whereas the grape, soybean, sorghum and rice genomes possess a single gene. The relevance of these lineage-specific gene duplication events remains to be investigated. Another striking feature of the CSL A group was the monocot-specific PoGO G.</p><p>Based on the evidence presented here, we conclude that XyG-specific &#x003b2;-glucan synthases in CSL C evolved from an ancestral &#x003b2;-mannan synthase represented by PoGO H, the ancestral group of the CSL C and A families. The presence of CSL C genes in charophytes is strong evidence that XyG emerged prior to the colonization of land by early embryophytes.

Evidence from non-XyG-bearing chlorophyte and streptophyte green algae indicates that part of the embryophyte XyG-related machinery (XTH, &#x003b2;-[1&#x02192;4]-glucan synthase from the CSL C family and &#x003b1;-xylosidase) evolved in an aquatic environment, before land colonization by plants. This conclusion agrees with a recent report by S&#x000f8;rensen <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] who used a combination of monosaccharide linkage analysis, CoMPP and immunolabeling to detect XyG in the PCW of some Charophycean algae, including Charales, Coleochaetales, and Zygnematales. Although Popper and Fry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] detected no XyG in the cell wall of streptophyte algae such as <italic>Chara</italic>, <italic>Nitella</italic>, <italic>Coleochaete </italic>and <italic>Klebsormidium</italic>, the presence of an XyG-like polymer containing glucose and xylose was also reported in the alga <italic>Spirogyra </italic>(a streptophyte from the Class Zygnematophyceaes; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]). In addition, XyG endotransglycosylase (XTH) activity has been detected in growing tissues of <italic>Chara </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Together, these observations suggest that in Charophycean algae a XyG-like polymer may be part of the PCW structure and that the mechanism by which hemicellulose is transglycosylated to adapt the PCW to cellular growth is conserved among streptophytes.</p><p>Streptophyta algae have at least three enzymes involved in XyG synthesis and turnover that are homologous to those of embryophytes, namely, XTH, &#x003b2;-(1&#x02192;4)-glucan synthase and &#x003b1;-xylosidase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Homologous of &#x003b1;-xylosidase are present in Chlorophyta algae that completely lack XyG. Overall, our findings support the idea that a primordial XyG-like polymer emerged before land colonization by plants. The selective advantage conferred by this polymer may have been related to cell-cell attachment features within streptophytes multicellular algae rather than to mechanical structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Once the land was colonized, XyG was definitively incorporated into the PCW, as exemplified by the presence of XyG in basal land plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Evolutionary model of XyG-related genes emergence in Viridiplantae kingdom</bold>.

For example, &#x003b1;-xylosidase activity possibly emerged from &#x003b1;-glucosidase, &#x003b2;-(1&#x02192;4)-glucan synthase-specific enzymes possibly emerged from enzymes with &#x003b2;-mannan activity, and &#x003b1;-fucosidase type I possibly emerged from the GDSL-motif lipase/hydrolase family.</p><p>There was a positive correlation between the number of founder genes in XyG-related gene families, defined by the number of PoGOs, and the growing complexity of the PCW. For instance, the number of PoGOs involving XTH sequences from streptophyte algae was limited to two but increased to 12 PoGOs shared amongst eudicots and monocots (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Overall, the higher number of PoGOs found to include angiosperm XyG-related genes compared to other plant groups was probably related to the high degree of specialization (expression pattern and/or functional novelties) among gene copies in angiosperm species.</p><p>In contrast, there was no clear correlation between the gene copy numbers of XyG GHs and GTs and the amount of XyG in PCW. For example, the moss <italic>Physcomitrella</italic>, as well as rice and sorghum (i.e, graminaceous monocots), in which XyG accounts for &#x0003c;5% of the PCW dry-weight, had 30, 30 and 32 XTH genes, respectively, a number similar to that observed in eudicots (33 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, 35 in poplar and soybean) in which XyG accounts for 10-20% of the PCW dry-weight. We speculate that remodeling of the PCW by the selective turnover and transglycosylation of XyG may be important, even for species with low amounts of XyG.</p><p>The role of XyG in embryophyte PCW remains unclear, although recent work has shown that <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>mutant plants with undetectable XyG have an almost normal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. More research is needed to improve our knowledge of the mechanical structure of the PCW and the relationships among its components.</p><p>Our data suggest that the colonization of land by plants was marked by a notable increase in the sophistication of the machinery required for XyG biosynthesis and turnover when compared to the pathways present in Streptophyta algae. This finding suggests that complex systems involving several enzymes may evolve in a stepwise manner, with each new step providing some selective advantage, as seen in the galactosylation of embryophyte XyG and fucosylation of spermatophyte XyG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). XTHs with exclusively hydrolytic activity emerged by the neofunctionalization of an enzyme with mixed activity (transglycosylase/hydrolase) in the last common ancestor of spermatophytes.
