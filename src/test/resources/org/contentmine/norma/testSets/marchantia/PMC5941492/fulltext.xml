VQs were phylogeneticly clustered into different groups, which were dependent on analyzed genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, no classification was reported, which is based on multiple species including non-seed plants.</p><p id="Par22">More than half of identified <italic>VQs</italic> were up- or down-regulated by abiotic stresses or phytohormones in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and Chinese cabbage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice and other plants, <italic>VQs</italic> were differentially regulated by not only abiotic but also biotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

VQs function as regulators by interacting with other proteins. Evidence showed that many WRKY transcription factors might interact with VQs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These interactions might stimulate DNA-binding or transcription-activating activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Sometimes, the interaction also repressed the DNA-binding activity of a WRKY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The VQ-WRKY interactions also regulated expression level of downstream genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Their interactions are sophisticated, which were regulated by not only phytohormones, abiotic or biotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], but also additional signalling components such as kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Besides WRKYs, SIB1 and kinases, VQs also interacted with PIF (a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Since the report of the first VQ protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], genome-wide identification and characterization was carried out in several genomes including <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (34 <italic>VQs</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]), soybean (74 <italic>VQs</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]), maize (61 <italic>VQs</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]), Chinese cabbage (57 <italic>VQs</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]) and grapevine (18 <italic>VQs</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]). However, no enough data is available for the analysis of their evolutionary histories and expansion mechanisms in this family. In this study, we identified these gene family members from 50 plant genomes, 12 of which were selected for further investigation on their selection force, evolutionary history and expansion mechanisms. We then surveyed the presence of this gene family in other species from animals, bacteria, fungi and viruses. We have also investigated the expansion patterns among species from the <italic>Oryza</italic> genus. We then surveyed expression profiling of <italic>VQs</italic> in different tissues and under various abiotic and biotic stresses as well as phytohormone treatment. Our analysis provides some new insights into the origin, evolution and comprehensive expression regulation of this gene family.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant genomes encode variable sizes of <italic>VQs</italic></title><p id="Par23">To better understand the general profile of <italic>VQs</italic> in the low and higher plant kingdom, we identified <italic>VQs</italic> in 50 completely sequenced genomes from algae, moss, gymnosperm and angiosperm by Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and BLASTP searches (Methods).

We have carried out a genome-wide identification of <italic>VQs</italic> in 43 nematode genomes by the HMM searches. These genomes were from 43 species including 10 free-living, 10 human parasitic, 13 animal parasitic (2 for entomopathogenic) and 10 plant parasitic nematodes (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3). No <italic>VQs</italic> were detected in 10 human parasitic nematodes.

Most of them contained only partial VQ motifs. These 11 genomes were from 5 free-living, 1 animal parasitic, and 5 plant parasitic species.

For the plant parasitic nematodes, 2 of them encoded only one <italic>VQ</italic> and the remaining 3 species encoded two <italic>VQs</italic> in each genome. On the other hand, a total of 249 fungus species, whose genomes were completely sequences, were used for the genome-wide identification of the <italic>VQ</italic> family. Their annotated protein sequences were downloaded from the EnsembleGenomes database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/access/ftp">http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/access/ftp</ext-link>) and were then submitted to the HMM searches.

Similar to the nematode <italic>VQs</italic>, most of these <italic>VQs</italic> encoded only partial VQ motif sequences. VQ motif sequences from the nematodes and fungi were aligned by Clustal X2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clustal.org/clustal2">http://www.clustal.org/clustal2/</ext-link>) and we found that only two amino acid residues &#x0201c;VQ&#x0201d; were conserved among all VQ motifs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The aligned sequences were then used for phylogenetic analysis and the constructed tree was shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. In the VQ motif-based tree, not all VQs from the nematodes were clustered together and some of them were grouped with the VQs from fungi (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The results showed the inconsistence between the evolution of VQs and their species divergence. Besides nematodes and fungi, we have identified several putative VQs from some bacterial species but no VQs were identified from viruses. Protein database from a total of 50 bacterial genomes were submitted to the HMM searches. As a result, 8 VQs were identified from 8 bacterial species including <italic>Aeromonas diversa</italic>, <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. <italic>BWH64</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus camelliae</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus manihotivorans</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic>, <italic>Leptospira terpstrae</italic>, <italic>Phaeospirillum molischianum</italic> and <italic>Weissella oryzae</italic>.

However, the classification was based on <italic>VQs</italic> from single or several species. Due to the difficulty in sequence alignment, we selected VQ motif sequences from 12 species including 5 monocotyledons (monocots), 5 eudicotyledons (dicots), 1 gymnosperm and 1 moss for phylogenetic analysis (see Methods). Based on the phylogenetic tree, the <italic>VQ</italic> family could be classified into 5 distinct groups and they were named as Group 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S1).

Due to possible inaccurateness in estimation of lost genes and pseudogenes, they were excluded in this analysis, which might under-estimate the MRCA members.

In <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>, <italic>VQs</italic> were localized on all 12 rice chromosomes with uneven distribution.

The fact suggested that these tandem duplication events occurred before the divergence of these rice species and some of them lost in some species during long evolutionary history. Interestingly, the tandem duplication could be detected only in the genus <italic>Oryza</italic> but was not in other four grass species. Thus, all these three tandem duplication events occurred after the divergence of rice genus from other grasses but before the presence of various rice species. Furthermore, we have also detected additional three tandem duplication events which occurred only in one species.

The fact suggests that these duplication events occurred after species divergence from the <italic>Oryza</italic> genus and were species specific and the duplicated <italic>VQs</italic> might take part in species divergence.

By combining all treatments, we found that all tested genes were up- or down-regulated by either phytohormes or abitic/biotic stress in rice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref> and Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Figure S3b-d). However, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, two genes were not regulated by any of tested phytohormone or abiotic/biotic stresses. On the other hand, 16 rice <italic>VQs</italic> were regulated only by abiotic/biotic stresses but not either ABA or JA, suggesting that these genes might function in a phytohormone-independent signalling pathway. Interestingly, all ABA/JA-regulated rice <italic>VQs</italic> were also down- or up-regulated by ether abiotic or biotic stresses. This result suggested the role of ABA/JA signalling in abiotic/biotic stress tolerance. However, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, some of ABA&#x02212;/JA-regulated genes were not regulated by abiotic/biotic stresses. These <italic>Arabidopsis VQs</italic> might be regulated by other abiotic/biotic stresses or play roles only in phytohormone-mediated non-stress-related biological processing. All of these analyses imply the difference in their biological functions for individual <italic>VQs</italic> between rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par40">By implementing an integrative approach, we provide new insights into gene expansion, divergence, evolution and their interaction networks of this VQ family. Our data showed that all genomes from moss, gymnosperm and angiosperm encode varying numbers of <italic>VQs</italic> and segmental duplication significantly contributed to the family expansion. VQs were very much conserved in their motif coding region and were under purifying selection although positive selection was also observed during species divergence. We also detected the presence of this family in other genomes from alga, animals, bacteria, fungi and viruses, which showed that no <italic>VQs</italic> were detected in all tested algae and virus genomes but VQs could be encoded by some of fungi, bacteria and lower animals. All of these data suggest that VQs are evolutionary conserved, ancient and not plant-specific. Many <italic>VQs</italic> were up- or down-regulated by various abiotic / biotic stresses and phytohormones in rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. They were also co-expressed with some of other stress-related genes. Thus, our data suggest the comprehensive expression regulation of this <italic>VQ</italic> gene family.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>Materials and growth conditions</title><p id="Par41">The fungus <italic>Gloeophyllum trabeum</italic> was a gift from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Products Laboratory (Madison, WI) and was routinely maintained on 2.5% malt agar plates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Genomic DNA and RNA isolation and gene cloning</title><p id="Par42">The fungus genomic DNA was isolated using Quick-DNA Fungal/Bacterial Miniprep Kit (50 Preps, ZYR.D6005), Zymo Research, USA.
